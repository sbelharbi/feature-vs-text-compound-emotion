val/dia5_utt1,2,What?
val/dia5_utt2,4,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
val/dia5_utt3,4,Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
val/dia5_utt4,4,The point is I...
val/dia5_utt5,4,I don't need this right now, OK.
val/dia5_utt6,4,It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy.
val/dia5_utt7,4,This ship has sailed.
val/dia5_utt8,4,Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
val/dia5_utt9,4,Fine.
val/dia5_utt10,4,Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
val/dia5_utt11,4,Good.
val/dia5_utt12,4,Good.
val/dia6_utt0,1,Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
val/dia6_utt1,0,Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
val/dia6_utt2,0,All in good time my love.
val/dia6_utt3,0,All in good time.
val/dia6_utt4,2,Oh shoot!
val/dia6_utt5,6,I left my guitar in their apartment.

val/dia6_utt7,0,I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
val/dia6_utt8,2,What?! They took mine to give to you!
val/dia6_utt9,2,Why would they take away our keys?
val/dia7_utt0,1,Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
val/dia7_utt1,1,Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
val/dia7_utt2,0,A
val/dia7_utt3,0,No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
val/dia7_utt4,2,Uh, what?
val/dia7_utt5,1,Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
val/dia7_utt6,2,What You're not serious.
val/dia7_utt7,4,I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her.
val/dia7_utt8,5,She'll drive us totally crazy.
val/dia7_utt9,1,Hi Ross!
val/dia7_utt10,1,Hi roomie!
val/dia8_utt0,0,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
val/dia8_utt1,0,I don't know!
val/dia8_utt2,0,It's not like it's porn!
val/dia8_utt3,0,This is a serious, legitimate movie.
val/dia8_utt4,0,And the nudity is really important to the story.
val/dia8_utt5,0,That's what you say about porn.
val/dia8_utt6,0,You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
val/dia8_utt7,1,No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
val/dia8_utt8,0,Well that's true.
val/dia8_utt9,0,And I am only naked in one scene.
val/dia8_utt10,0,Plus it sounds really great.
val/dia8_utt11,0,My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
val/dia8_utt12,0,Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
val/dia8_utt13,0,So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
val/dia8_utt14,1,It's really sweet and-and tender.
val/dia9_utt0,0,Hey, what's up?
val/dia9_utt1,6,Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
val/dia9_utt2,0,But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
val/dia9_utt3,1,"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
val/dia9_utt4,0,Yeah?
val/dia9_utt5,0,I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know?
val/dia9_utt6,0,Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me.
val/dia9_utt7,0,And what's more different than me. A guy who's
val/dia10_utt0,0,So where are we going next?
val/dia10_utt1,0,This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
val/dia10_utt2,3,Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
val/dia10_utt3,1,Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
val/dia10_utt4,4,It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
val/dia10_utt5,4,Yeah, no one talks like that!
val/dia10_utt6,4,Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
val/dia10_utt7,4,Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
val/dia10_utt8,0,How do you figure that?
val/dia10_utt9,0,Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
val/dia11_utt0,0,I guess so.
val/dia11_utt1,0,Here you go. Thank you!
val/dia11_utt2,0,Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
val/dia11_utt3,2,Oh what, you-you want both of them?
val/dia11_utt4,4,Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
val/dia11_utt5,3,Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it.
val/dia11_utt6,0,I know it's in the apartment, but I
val/dia11_utt7,3,Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
val/dia11_utt8,4,Tell her to wear her own earrings.
val/dia11_utt9,0,These
val/dia11_utt10,4,Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
val/dia11_utt11,0,Why not?
val/dia11_utt12,4,Because I lose her stuff!
val/dia12_utt0,0,Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?

val/dia13_utt12,2,Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
val/dia13_utt13,2,They musta read the sonogram wrong.
val/dia13_utt14,2,Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!
val/dia13_utt15,2,Chandler's a girl!
val/dia13_utt16,1,Okay, keep saying it!
val/dia13_utt17,0,Am I too late?!
val/dia13_utt18,1,No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

val/dia15_utt9,3,Ooh! Ah! Okay!
val/dia16_utt0,0,Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing
val/dia16_utt1,6,we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
val/dia16_utt2,2,Oh just say it Kyle!
val/dia16_utt3,1,We're gonna give it another try.
val/dia16_utt4,4,What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
val/dia16_utt5,0,I'm gonna work on that.
val/dia16_utt6,4,Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
val/dia16_utt7,4,Y'know, he hums when he pees!
val/dia16_utt8,0,I do know.
val/dia16_utt9,5,It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
val/dia16_utt10,6,We're so sorry.
val/dia16_utt11,4,That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
val/dia16_utt12,4,Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
val/dia16_utt13,0,Yeah, we're gonna go.
val/dia16_utt14,6,I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she
val/dia16_utt15,0,Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
val/dia16_utt16,4,Yeah, we're better off without them.
val/dia16_utt17,4,And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
val/dia16_utt18,6,Divorced men's club.
val/dia17_utt0,4,Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
val/dia17_utt1,4,Maybe because you've got the keys?
val/dia17_utt2,4,This is totally your fault!
val/dia17_utt3,4,My fault?! You threatened the judge!
val/dia17_utt4,4,Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
val/dia18_utt0,0,Phoebe!
val/dia18_utt1,0,Yeah?
val/dia18_utt2,0,Have you seen Chandler?!
val/dia18_utt3,0,No! Why?
val/dia18_utt4,3,The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!
val/dia18_utt5,3,I know!
val/dia18_utt6,3,How bad is this?
val/dia18_utt7,3,Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
val/dia18_utt8,3,I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
val/dia18_utt9,0,What are you gonna do?
val/dia18_utt10,4,Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure!
val/dia18_utt11,0,"Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
val/dia18_utt12,2,Rachel said that!
val/dia18_utt13,4,Well Rachel's not here!
val/dia19_utt0,0,Come on, come on.
val/dia19_utt1,4,Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.
val/dia19_utt2,4,This is all your fault.
val/dia19_utt3,4,This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?
val/dia19_utt4,4,My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
val/dia19_utt5,4,The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
val/dia19_utt6,4,No no no, believe me.
val/dia19_utt7,4,No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?
val/dia19_utt8,0,And you know what the funny thing is?
val/dia19_utt9,4,When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?
val/dia19_utt10,6,Where does that leave me?
val/dia19_utt11,0,You get to be the baby's father.
val/dia19_utt12,0,Everyone knows who you are.
val/dia19_utt13,4,Who am I?
val/dia19_utt14,6,There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
val/dia19_utt15,0,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
val/dia19_utt16,1,This is so great.
val/dia19_utt17,0,You wanna explain that?
val/dia19_utt18,6,I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.
val/dia19_utt19,1,And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.
val/dia19_utt20,6,And it's not even born yet.
val/dia19_utt21,1,It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.
val/dia19_utt22,6,I'm sorry, you were fighting.
val/dia20_utt0,0,Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
val/dia20_utt1,0,Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
val/dia20_utt2,1,I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
val/dia20_utt3,0,It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
val/dia20_utt4,5,Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
val/dia20_utt5,5,This is disgusting!
val/dia20_utt6,5,I'm not reading this!
val/dia20_utt7,2,What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
val/dia21_utt0,0,All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
val/dia21_utt1,0,I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
val/dia21_utt2,0,You know he's gay?
val/dia21_utt3,0,I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
val/dia21_utt4,0,Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
val/dia21_utt5,0,Hi. Hi.
val/dia21_utt6,2,What are you doing here?
val/dia22_utt0,0,Well, what?
val/dia22_utt1,0,What?
val/dia22_utt2,0,What is it?
val/dia22_utt3,2,That she left you?
val/dia22_utt4,0,That she likes women?
val/dia22_utt5,0,That she left you for another woman that likes women?
val/dia22_utt6,4,Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
val/dia22_utt7,0,Then what?
val/dia22_utt8,0,My first time with Carol was...
val/dia22_utt9,0,What?
val/dia22_utt10,0,It was my
val/dia22_utt11,2,With Carol?  Oh.
val/dia22_utt12,2,So in your whole life, you've only been with one  oh.
val/dia22_utt13,2,Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
val/dia23_utt0,0,Hi. Where is everybody?
val/dia23_utt1,6,Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
val/dia23_utt2,6,My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
val/dia23_utt3,2,Oh no! Why?
val/dia23_utt4,6, Cause Carol's a lesbian.  And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
val/dia23_utt5,2,Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
val/dia23_utt6,5,I'm an idiot.
val/dia23_utt7,6,I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
val/dia23_utt8,0,Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
val/dia23_utt9,2,Well, now I do!!
val/dia23_utt10,6,I'm sorry.
val/dia23_utt11,6,Seven years.
val/dia23_utt12,6,I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
val/dia23_utt13,6,Aw, God Ross. Oh.
val/dia24_utt0,0,I'll do it.
val/dia24_utt1,0,No you won't.
val/dia24_utt2,6,Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry.
val/dia24_utt3,0,But,  you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
val/dia24_utt4,1,Okay, absolutely!
val/dia24_utt5,0,All right.
val/dia24_utt6,0,You've got it.
val/dia24_utt7,4,Cookie, now you can punch him!
val/dia24_utt8,2,What?!
val/dia25_utt0,4,All right, that's it, I quit.
val/dia25_utt1,2,What? I didn't say anything.
val/dia25_utt2,4,Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.
val/dia25_utt3,4,Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
val/dia25_utt4,6,I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
val/dia25_utt5,4,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
val/dia26_utt0,0,Julie.
val/dia26_utt1,2,What?!
val/dia26_utt2,2,Jody!
val/dia26_utt3,0,You were with Julie?
val/dia26_utt4,0,Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.
val/dia26_utt5,0,And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
val/dia26_utt6,2,Oh. Oh my God.
val/dia26_utt7,6,Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
val/dia26_utt8,4,Yeah, right.  Sure!
val/dia26_utt9,6,Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.
val/dia26_utt10,6,Look, I'm sorry, all right.
val/dia26_utt11,6,I never meant for you to find out!
val/dia26_utt12,4,Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
val/dia26_utt13,4,That is not true!
val/dia26_utt14,4,Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
val/dia26_utt15,4,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
val/dia26_utt16,6,Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to
val/dia27_utt0,2,Yeah!
val/dia27_utt1,0,I can't say.
val/dia27_utt2,2,Why?!
val/dia27_utt3,6,Why not?
val/dia27_utt4,0,I can't say because he's famous.
val/dia27_utt5,2,Oh my God, who is it?!
val/dia27_utt6,4,Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
val/dia27_utt7,0,Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
val/dia27_utt8,2,As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
val/dia27_utt9,2,What?! Well he never said that to me!
val/dia28_utt0,0,In
val/dia28_utt1,6,Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
val/dia28_utt2,1,Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
val/dia28_utt3,0,Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
val/dia28_utt4,0,I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
val/dia28_utt5,6,Oh, let's not tell this story.
val/dia28_utt6,6,Oh, come on!
val/dia28_utt7,1,Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
val/dia28_utt8,2,What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
val/dia28_utt9,0,Hey, it's not like it sounds.
val/dia28_utt10,0,It's
val/dia29_utt0,4,Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
val/dia29_utt1,0,Who was that?
val/dia29_utt2,6,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
val/dia29_utt3,6,Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
val/dia29_utt4,0,Ten dollars an hour.
val/dia29_utt5,0,No.
val/dia29_utt6,0,Twelve dollars an hour.
val/dia29_utt7,0,Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
val/dia29_utt8,4,You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.
val/dia29_utt9,4,I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.
val/dia29_utt10,1,Done.
val/dia30_utt0,3,The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
val/dia30_utt1,3,You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
val/dia30_utt2,3,No! I won't leave you!
val/dia30_utt3,6,Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
val/dia30_utt4,4,No you're not! Not to me!
val/dia30_utt5,2,Oh my God.
val/dia30_utt6,0,What?
val/dia30_utt7,0,I am
val/dia30_utt8,1,Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from
val/dia30_utt9,1,No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
val/dia30_utt10,1,Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
val/dia30_utt11,0,Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
val/dia30_utt12,0,Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
val/dia30_utt13,4,Fine!
val/dia30_utt14,4,I'll do it without you!
val/dia30_utt15,4,I don't need you or anybody else!
val/dia30_utt16,4,I'm gonna make it on my own!
val/dia30_utt17,4,You'll see!!
val/dia30_utt18,0,You'll
val/dia31_utt0,6,I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
val/dia31_utt1,2,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
val/dia31_utt2,6,We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
val/dia31_utt3,0,I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
val/dia31_utt4,0,And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
val/dia31_utt5,6,I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.
val/dia31_utt6,1,But you didn't!
val/dia31_utt7,1,I'm still alive!!
val/dia31_utt8,1,Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.
val/dia31_utt9,1,It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day!
val/dia31_utt10,1,I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!
val/dia31_utt11,4,You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!
val/dia31_utt12,1,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
val/dia32_utt0,0,We'll do a quick check.
val/dia32_utt1,0,Okay.
val/dia32_utt2,2,So, eight days late huh?
val/dia32_utt3,0,Yeah.
val/dia32_utt4,0,You must be a little uncomfortable.
val/dia32_utt5,0,Eh, just a tad.
val/dia32_utt6,0,You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way.
val/dia32_utt7,0,It still could last a little while longer.
val/dia32_utt8,0,If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
val/dia32_utt9,4,Do them!!
val/dia32_utt10,0,Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.
val/dia32_utt11,0,Well, we are ready to try anything.
val/dia32_utt12,0,Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
val/dia32_utt13,0,Okay.
val/dia33_utt0,6,What is wrong with Emma?
val/dia33_utt1,0,Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
val/dia34_utt0,0,Anytime you're ready.
val/dia34_utt1,0,Ok, ok, here we go.
val/dia34_utt2,0,Ok, where am I talking to, here?
val/dia34_utt3,0,I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
val/dia34_utt4,0,Just aim for the bump.
val/dia34_utt5,0,Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.
val/dia34_utt6,3,You know, I, you know, can't do this.
val/dia34_utt7,5,Uh, this is too weird.
val/dia34_utt8,6,I feel stupid.
val/dia34_utt9,0,So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
val/dia34_utt10,1,Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
val/dia35_utt0,0,Oh, hi. It's Mark.
val/dia36_utt0,3,Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
val/dia36_utt1,0,Okay, I do.
val/dia36_utt2,0,Okay.
val/dia36_utt3,0,I really do.
val/dia36_utt4,0,Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
val/dia36_utt5,6,Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
val/dia36_utt6,2,Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
val/dia36_utt7,0,Okay.
val/dia36_utt8,0,Okay?
val/dia36_utt9,2,Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
val/dia36_utt10,3,What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
val/dia36_utt11,5,I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
val/dia37_utt0,0,Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
val/dia37_utt1,3,Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
val/dia37_utt2,3,Oh, I can't watch this.
val/dia37_utt3,2,Check it out, he's winning!  Pete's winning!
val/dia37_utt4,2,Really?!
val/dia37_utt5,3,No-o-o!!
val/dia37_utt6,3,Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
val/dia37_utt7,5,Oh! Oh!
val/dia37_utt8,2,Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
val/dia37_utt9,2,Well, this is ironic.
val/dia37_utt10,0,Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
val/dia38_utt0,4,Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
val/dia39_utt0,0,Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
val/dia39_utt1,1,We could, or we can have sex in it.
val/dia39_utt2,1,Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
val/dia40_utt0,2,I thought I was a complete idiot.
val/dia40_utt1,0,Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
val/dia40_utt2,5,Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
val/dia40_utt3,0,I said no.
val/dia40_utt4,2,What?!
val/dia40_utt5,2,What? I I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
val/dia40_utt6,4,Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
val/dia40_utt7,0,I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
val/dia40_utt8,3,Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
val/dia40_utt9,6,Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great
val/dia40_utt10,1,Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet  em all!
val/dia41_utt0,0,Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
val/dia41_utt1,0,That's okay.
val/dia41_utt2,0,She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
val/dia42_utt0,4,Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
val/dia42_utt1,4,You tell them to wait!
val/dia42_utt2,0,Okay. Wait! Wait!
val/dia42_utt3,0,Emily.
val/dia42_utt4,4,Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!
val/dia43_utt0,0,Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
val/dia43_utt1,0,Okay.
val/dia44_utt0,6,I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
val/dia44_utt1,4,Nevermind!
val/dia44_utt2,0,No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
val/dia44_utt3,0,Jen.
val/dia44_utt4,0,Jen, I know this may sound a little  But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
val/dia44_utt5,1,Sure! That would be nice.
val/dia44_utt6,0,Umm?
val/dia44_utt7,1,Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
val/dia44_utt8,0,I will give you a call.
val/dia44_utt9,0,I'll see you later.
val/dia44_utt10,1,Okay!
val/dia44_utt11,0,I forgot my paper.
val/dia45_utt0,0,Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
val/dia45_utt1,0,What?
val/dia45_utt2,0,Okay.
val/dia45_utt3,2,Ow!
val/dia45_utt4,0,Aren't you gonna go?
val/dia45_utt5,0,No. Thank you.
val/dia45_utt6,0,No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
val/dia45_utt7,0,Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is  no tissue, no tuschy.'  Well, if everybody's going.
val/dia45_utt8,0,No, y'know what don't close it   cause the... keys...are in there.
val/dia45_utt9,3,Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
val/dia45_utt10,0,What's going on?
val/dia45_utt11,3,My lighter's in there!
val/dia46_utt0,0,I promise.
val/dia46_utt1,0,Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
val/dia46_utt2,0,Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
val/dia46_utt3,0,No, no he's not.
val/dia46_utt4,2,You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
val/dia46_utt5,2,What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
val/dia46_utt6,0,Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
val/dia46_utt7,0,Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
val/dia46_utt8,3,It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
val/dia46_utt9,0,Well, you could wait  til I go to the dentist, maybe
val/dia47_utt0,0,Hey, what are you doing here?
val/dia47_utt1,0,Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of
val/dia47_utt2,0,Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
val/dia47_utt3,0,Where's Ben?
val/dia47_utt4,0,He's sleeping.
val/dia47_utt5,2,Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
val/dia47_utt6,1,Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
val/dia47_utt7,2,Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
val/dia47_utt8,0,It's not that kind of anniversary.
val/dia47_utt9,2,Ah!  Oh.
val/dia47_utt10,0,Sooo!! Anyway...
val/dia48_utt0,0,Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
val/dia48_utt1,1,Oh, oh, oh, I'll get  Rainy Day Bear'!!

val/dia48_utt3,3,Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
val/dia48_utt4,0,Give it. Give it.
val/dia48_utt5,0,Okay.
val/dia48_utt6,2,Oh!!
val/dia48_utt7,6,Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
val/dia49_utt0,4,Please. This is so your fault.
val/dia49_utt1,2,How, how is this my fault?
val/dia49_utt2,4,Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
val/dia49_utt3,4,Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
val/dia49_utt6,4,Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!
val/dia49_utt7,4,Get in here.
val/dia49_utt8,0,Come on.
val/dia49_utt9,4,My god, you guys, I don't believe you.
val/dia49_utt10,4,There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.
val/dia49_utt11,4,So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
val/dia49_utt12,0,Yeah, Susan.
val/dia49_utt13,4,Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
val/dia49_utt14,0,Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
val/dia50_utt0,2,Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
val/dia50_utt1,2,I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
val/dia50_utt2,4,Son of a bitch!
val/dia50_utt3,0,Okay, maybe ask this guy.
val/dia51_utt0,0,Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
val/dia51_utt1,1,Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
val/dia51_utt2,0,Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is
val/dia51_utt3,0,The
val/dia51_utt4,0,Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big
val/dia51_utt5,0,Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
val/dia51_utt6,4,Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
val/dia52_utt0,0,Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
val/dia52_utt1,1,Sure, I love this part!
val/dia52_utt2,0,Come on in.
val/dia53_utt0,1,Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
val/dia53_utt1,0,In the moment, yeah.
val/dia53_utt2,1,But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
val/dia53_utt3,0,Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
val/dia53_utt4,0,No.
val/dia53_utt5,0,Me neither.
val/dia53_utt6,0,3, 2,
val/dia53_utt7,1,Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
val/dia53_utt8,1,Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
val/dia54_utt0,0,Alright. Phoebe?
val/dia54_utt1,0,Okay, okay.
val/dia54_utt2,1,If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
val/dia54_utt3,0,Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
val/dia54_utt4,0,Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
val/dia54_utt5,5,See, there's always one guy.  "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
val/dia54_utt6,0,Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
val/dia54_utt7,0,Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
val/dia54_utt8,6,Probably kill myself!
val/dia54_utt9,2,..Excuse me?
val/dia54_utt10,6,Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
val/dia54_utt11,2,Joey, uh-
val/dia54_utt12,0,You
val/dia55_utt0,6,I'm sorry.
val/dia56_utt0,4,Joey, onstage!
val/dia56_utt1,6,Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
val/dia56_utt2,6,I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
val/dia56_utt3,0,Where are you Vic?
val/dia56_utt4,6,Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
val/dia56_utt5,4,Vic! Vic!
val/dia56_utt6,4,In a minute!!
val/dia56_utt7,6,So this is it? Victor?
val/dia56_utt8,6,Yeah, I guess it is.
val/dia56_utt9,6,Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick  cause this is killing me.
val/dia56_utt10,6,One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.
val/dia56_utt11,6,But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I.
val/dia56_utt12,6,And so  I'm gonna get on this spaceship,  and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.
val/dia56_utt13,6,But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone.
val/dia56_utt14,0,But I won't have aged at all.
val/dia56_utt15,0,So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
val/dia56_utt16,6,So long, Vic!
val/dia57_utt0,0,Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is
val/dia57_utt1,0,See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on
val/dia57_utt2,0,What song was that, Pheebs?
val/dia57_utt3,1,Hi Monica!
val/dia57_utt4,1,Hey Mon!
val/dia57_utt5,1,Hey Mon!
val/dia57_utt6,2,Oh my God, has she slept at all?
val/dia57_utt7,0,Nope.
val/dia57_utt8,0,No, it's been three nights in a row.
val/dia57_utt9,0,Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
val/dia57_utt10,0,Oh, okay that explains it.
val/dia57_utt11,0,I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.
val/dia57_utt12,1,But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
val/dia58_utt0,0,So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
val/dia58_utt1,5,Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
val/dia58_utt2,0,Yeah, I know but
val/dia58_utt3,0,Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
val/dia58_utt4,2,Hey!
val/dia58_utt5,1,Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
val/dia58_utt6,2,You made pancakes?
val/dia58_utt7,1,Yep! Grab a plate.
val/dia58_utt8,0,No-no, stay right there.  Gettin' closer.
val/dia58_utt9,0,Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,
val/dia58_utt10,0,Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
val/dia58_utt11,1,Oh yeah!
val/dia59_utt0,0,Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
val/dia59_utt1,0,Yeah, hero sandwiches.
val/dia59_utt2,0,Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.
val/dia59_utt3,0,When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.
val/dia59_utt4,0,Not you Joey.
val/dia60_utt0,2,Oh my good God.
val/dia60_utt1,0,Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
val/dia60_utt2,4,Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
val/dia60_utt3,1,I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
val/dia60_utt4,0,Oh, the mixed tape.
val/dia60_utt5,1,The Way You Look Tonight
val/dia60_utt6,1,You are just the sweetest.
val/dia61_utt0,1,Hey!
val/dia61_utt1,1,Hey!
val/dia61_utt2,0,Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
val/dia61_utt3,0,What?
val/dia61_utt4,0,I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
val/dia61_utt5,1,Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
val/dia62_utt0,0,So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find
val/dia62_utt1,1,Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
val/dia62_utt2,2,Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someone's been doing their homework.
val/dia62_utt3,0,Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so
val/dia62_utt4,0,Oh, I know.  Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
val/dia62_utt5,0,Oh, me too.
val/dia63_utt0,1,and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
val/dia63_utt1,0,Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
val/dia63_utt2,4,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
val/dia63_utt3,1,It was really fun being married to you tonight.
val/dia63_utt4,1,Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.
val/dia63_utt5,6,Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
val/dia63_utt6,0,Yeah.
val/dia63_utt7,0,That proposal, at the planetarium
val/dia63_utt8,6,I know, I know it was stupid.
val/dia63_utt9,2,Are you kidding?!
val/dia63_utt10,1,With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!
val/dia63_utt11,1,It was really wonderful!
val/dia63_utt12,2,Did you just make that up?
val/dia63_utt13,0,No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.
val/dia63_utt14,0,It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
val/dia63_utt15,0,Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
val/dia63_utt16,0,It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night
val/dia63_utt17,0,Goodnight
val/dia63_utt18,0,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
val/dia63_utt19,0,I will think about it.
val/dia63_utt20,0,That's all I'm askin'
val/dia64_utt0,2,You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
val/dia64_utt1,1,Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
val/dia64_utt2,0,No it isn't, I ate that.
val/dia64_utt3,0,Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
val/dia64_utt4,0,Nope, got it and I got yours  too.
val/dia65_utt0,1,And that's I'm so glad  there's no problem.
val/dia65_utt1,0,That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
val/dia65_utt2,1,Ohh! That's great!
val/dia65_utt3,0,You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the
val/dia65_utt4,2,Really?!
val/dia65_utt5,1,No-ho-ho!
val/dia65_utt6,0,Yeah.
val/dia65_utt7,0,I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job.
val/dia65_utt8,0,Although, I might need some convincing.
val/dia65_utt9,3,Well, I, umm
val/dia65_utt10,1,Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
val/dia66_utt0,2,Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
val/dia66_utt1,0,Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk.
val/dia66_utt2,0,Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
val/dia66_utt3,2,I think it means he freaked out and left!

val/dia77_utt1,2,Look at Emma!
val/dia77_utt2,0,I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
val/dia77_utt3,1,Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
val/dia77_utt4,0,I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?
val/dia77_utt5,0,No, I know.
val/dia77_utt6,0,I know, because you're not in that place.

val/dia77_utt12,6,And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.
val/dia77_utt13,6,It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out I could never do that to Emma.
val/dia77_utt14,6,I mean she-she thinking everything  Oh that's now me.
val/dia77_utt15,0,What do they put something in the water in this place?
val/dia77_utt16,6,Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
val/dia77_utt17,0,I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
val/dia77_utt18,0,Yeah, exactly.

val/dia79_utt8,0,Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.
val/dia79_utt9,0,I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
val/dia79_utt10,6,But I don't wanna do it in a cup!

val/dia83_utt4,0,Look, we've always talked about having babies someday.
val/dia83_utt5,0,I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it.

val/dia86_utt3,0,Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
val/dia87_utt0,0,Oh... ok, fine.

val/dia89_utt2,3,Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
val/dia89_utt3,0,Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?
val/dia89_utt4,0,No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring.
val/dia89_utt5,6,Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
val/dia89_utt6,6,Sorry.
val/dia89_utt7,6,Sorry!

val/dia90_utt0,1,Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
val/dia90_utt1,0,Rachel, how did this happen?
val/dia90_utt2,3,I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
val/dia90_utt3,0,Where?
val/dia90_utt4,0,At his apartment. Is this juice?
val/dia90_utt5,4,Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
val/dia90_utt6,6,Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
val/dia91_utt0,2,I licked my arm, what?
val/dia91_utt1,0,It's breast milk.
val/dia91_utt2,0,So?
val/dia91_utt3,0,Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
val/dia91_utt4,4,What is the big deal?
val/dia91_utt5,2,What did you just do?
val/dia91_utt6,5,Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
val/dia91_utt7,0,You won't even taste it?
val/dia91_utt8,5,No!
val/dia91_utt9,0,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
val/dia91_utt10,5,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
val/dia92_utt0,2,Aww!
val/dia92_utt1,5,Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new  old sheet?
val/dia92_utt2,1,Oh sure!  Noo!
val/dia92_utt3,2,Ohh!!
val/dia92_utt4,2,My apothecary table!!!
val/dia92_utt5,2,What?!
val/dia92_utt6,3,Noooooo!!
val/dia92_utt7,2,Ross, where did you get this?!
val/dia92_utt8,4,Oh my God, Phoebe,
val/dia92_utt9,4,Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
val/dia92_utt10,5,Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
val/dia92_utt11,4,Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
val/dia93_utt0,6,How is she?
val/dia93_utt1,0,It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
val/dia93_utt2,0,How's the hair?
val/dia93_utt3,6,I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.
val/dia93_utt4,0,I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
val/dia93_utt5,0,Can we see her?
val/dia93_utt6,6,Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
val/dia93_utt7,6,How're you doing?
val/dia94_utt0,0,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
val/dia94_utt1,1,Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
val/dia94_utt2,5,That would be no.
val/dia94_utt3,0,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
val/dia94_utt4,0,Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
val/dia94_utt5,1,Cantaloupe juice.
val/dia94_utt6,0,Exactly.
val/dia94_utt7,2,You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
val/dia94_utt8,0,Uh huh.
val/dia94_utt9,4,Oh, you've tasted it.
val/dia94_utt10,0,You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
val/dia94_utt11,4,Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
val/dia95_utt0,4,I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
val/dia95_utt1,0,Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
val/dia95_utt2,4,Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.
val/dia95_utt3,0,Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
val/dia95_utt4,0,Regina Philange.
val/dia95_utt5,2,I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.
val/dia95_utt6,4,I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
val/dia95_utt7,2,I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
val/dia95_utt8,4,Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
val/dia95_utt9,0,Well maybe it was all of your questions.
val/dia95_utt10,0,What about my questions?
val/dia96_utt0,0,No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
val/dia96_utt1,0,Oh, I'll get it.
val/dia96_utt2,2,Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
val/dia96_utt3,1,Relax, it's not like we're forking.
val/dia97_utt0,1,Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
val/dia97_utt1,1,Hey!
val/dia97_utt2,0,Hello.
val/dia97_utt3,1,Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
val/dia97_utt4,1,I know!!!
val/dia97_utt5,1,So, I'm here, ready to play.
val/dia97_utt6,0,Okay.
val/dia97_utt7,1,I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
val/dia97_utt8,2,What's this?
val/dia97_utt9,1,That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
val/dia97_utt10,2,Not one that can pee on the roof.
val/dia97_utt11,1,Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
val/dia97_utt12,2,And is this in case the house sneezes?
val/dia97_utt13,0,No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
val/dia97_utt14,3,I don't want a ghost.
val/dia97_utt15,0,Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
val/dia97_utt16,2,Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
val/dia97_utt17,0,Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
val/dia97_utt18,2,Hey!
val/dia97_utt19,0,Hello.
val/dia97_utt20,1,I need to talk to you!
val/dia97_utt21,0,Sure, what's up?
val/dia98_utt0,4,All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
val/dia98_utt1,5,Please, I'm not going for anything.
val/dia98_utt2,4,Well, if you don't, I will.
val/dia98_utt3,1,Would you please go?
val/dia98_utt4,4,I would!
val/dia99_utt0,1,Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
val/dia99_utt1,0,Uh-huh.
val/dia99_utt2,1,Watch, watch.
val/dia99_utt3,2,Ooohhhh!!
val/dia99_utt4,1,And, and!
val/dia99_utt5,2,Ahhhh!!
val/dia99_utt6,2,Hey, my Father's house does that!
val/dia99_utt7,0,O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
val/dia99_utt8,0,Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
val/dia100_utt0,0,Okay. It's Emma.
val/dia101_utt0,6,Emma!  See? I don't want it.
val/dia102_utt0,0,Take it.
val/dia102_utt1,0,What?
val/dia103_utt0,0,It's clearly an Emma.
val/dia103_utt1,6,Oh honey, but you love that name.
val/dia103_utt2,1,Yeah, but I love you more.
val/dia103_utt3,0,Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing.
val/dia103_utt4,1,So I'm screwed.
val/dia104_utt0,1,Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
val/dia104_utt1,6,Nice try.
val/dia104_utt2,1,Wait, wait, wait!
val/dia104_utt3,0,Look, Monica
val/dia104_utt4,2,Look!
val/dia104_utt5,4,This is not going to work.
val/dia104_utt6,1,I bet this will work!
val/dia104_utt7,1,You are so great! I love you!
val/dia104_utt8,2,What?
val/dia104_utt9,3,Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
val/dia104_utt10,2,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
val/dia104_utt11,3,No I didn't!
val/dia104_utt12,2,Yes, you did!
val/dia104_utt13,3,No I didn't!
val/dia104_utt14,1,You love me!

val/dia106_utt0,0,Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
val/dia106_utt1,0,Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
val/dia106_utt2,0,What's a Movement class?
val/dia106_utt3,0,It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
val/dia106_utt4,1,Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
val/dia106_utt5,0,Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
val/dia107_utt0,0,I am.
val/dia107_utt1,0,Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
val/dia107_utt2,2,You really think so?
val/dia107_utt3,2,Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
val/dia108_utt0,2,Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the

val/dia108_utt10,1,Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!
val/dia108_utt11,1,Hi!
val/dia108_utt12,3,That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
val/dia108_utt13,0,Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
val/dia108_utt14,0,Yeah.
val/dia109_utt0,0,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
val/dia109_utt1,1,But sadly I could not be enticed.
val/dia109_utt2,5,Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
val/dia109_utt3,6,I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
val/dia109_utt4,4,Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not.
val/dia109_utt5,0,Eh?
val/dia109_utt6,0,All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.
val/dia109_utt7,0,I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
val/dia110_utt0,0,Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
val/dia110_utt1,0,Yeah.
val/dia110_utt2,0,Well, what period is it from?

val/dia110_utt4,0,Yes, yes I do.
val/dia110_utt5,1,God, oh it's just perfect!
val/dia110_utt6,1,I bet it has a great story behind it too.
val/dia110_utt8,1,Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
val/dia110_utt9,1,White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
val/dia111_utt0,4,So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
val/dia111_utt1,0,Huh?
val/dia111_utt2,0,I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
val/dia112_utt0,4,I, umm, shut up!
val/dia112_utt1,6, Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.  You just wrote this!
val/dia112_utt2,0,Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
val/dia112_utt3,6,Noooo!!
val/dia112_utt4,0,All right, hang on!
val/dia113_utt0,0,Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
val/dia113_utt1,6,But I
val/dia113_utt2,0,No-no, wait!
val/dia113_utt3,6,Just let me finish, okay?
val/dia113_utt4,0,This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want.
val/dia113_utt5,0,And it
val/dia113_utt6,2,It is? Really?
val/dia113_utt7,0,Yeah, sweetie.
val/dia113_utt8,6,I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
val/dia113_utt9,6,No.
val/dia113_utt10,6,What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
val/dia113_utt11,6,I'm gonna miss you!
val/dia113_utt12,6,I mean it's the end of an era!
val/dia113_utt13,6,I know!
