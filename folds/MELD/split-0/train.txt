train/dia0_utt10,3,No don't I beg of you!

train/dia9_utt9,1,Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
train/dia9_utt10,0,Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
train/dia9_utt11,0,I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.

train/dia20_utt9,0,That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
train/dia20_utt10,0,Didn't you sleep together?
train/dia20_utt11,0,Yeah, that really calms me down.
train/dia20_utt12,1,And!
train/dia20_utt13,1,We have so much in common!

train/dia21_utt6,4,I got no sleep last night!
train/dia21_utt7,0,Why?
train/dia21_utt8,5,My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.
train/dia21_utt9,0,Oh, and deaf.
train/dia21_utt10,0,So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.
train/dia21_utt11,5,You have no idea how loud they are!

train/dia26_utt12,0,Yeah, it is.
train/dia26_utt13,0,No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.

train/dia29_utt1,1,I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
train/dia29_utt2,0,Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.

train/dia29_utt4,2,What?  Why?
train/dia29_utt6,4,Chandler, we have talked about this.
train/dia29_utt7,4,You are not supposed to give people advice!
train/dia29_utt8,4,Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
train/dia29_utt9,0,I
train/dia29_utt10,4,They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
train/dia29_utt11,4,She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone
train/dia29_utt12,2,Man, that's some
train/dia29_utt13,0,Oh, that's not what you want...

train/dia39_utt1,4,Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be!
train/dia39_utt2,2,Huh?
train/dia39_utt3,4,Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!
train/dia39_utt4,4,I talk to you and nothin'.
train/dia39_utt5,4,You look at me, and it's nothin'.
train/dia39_utt6,4,Nothing.
train/dia39_utt7,1,Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
train/dia39_utt8,0,I have a question about this scene.
train/dia39_utt9,0,Yes?
train/dia39_utt10,5,Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
train/dia39_utt11,0,Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
train/dia39_utt12,0,Yeah.
train/dia39_utt13,0,I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
train/dia39_utt14,0,Oh, hey, how about this one.
train/dia39_utt15,4,Ah, it's says so in the script!
train/dia39_utt16,4,Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
train/dia39_utt17,4,It doesn't say that in the script.
train/dia39_utt18,4,It does in mine!
train/dia40_utt0,4,I can't
train/dia40_utt1,4,Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
train/dia40_utt2,0,Y'know who has a great video camera?
train/dia40_utt3,0,Greg and Jenny?
train/dia40_utt4,0,Do you still wanna call  em? I wanna call  em.
train/dia40_utt5,0,Let's call  em.

train/dia40_utt11,2,Hello?   It's the deli again!
train/dia40_utt12,1,All right! I'll have a sandwich!

train/dia41_utt3,0,Sure. So how long you been...
train/dia41_utt4,0,Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
train/dia41_utt5,2,Since then?!
train/dia41_utt6,0,No, it's only been six years.
train/dia41_utt7,0,I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
train/dia41_utt8,0,...Joe.
train/dia41_utt9,0,Y'ever been in love?
train/dia41_utt10,0,...I d'know.
train/dia41_utt11,0,Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
train/dia41_utt12,5,You're one to talk.
train/dia41_utt13,0,Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
train/dia41_utt14,5,Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
train/dia41_utt15,2,Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
train/dia42_utt0,0,Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
train/dia42_utt1,2,Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  That's supposed to be a duck right?  Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
train/dia43_utt0,0,Hey, Rach, how was work?
train/dia43_utt1,0,Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
train/dia43_utt2,0,By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
train/dia43_utt3,0,Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
train/dia43_utt4,0,I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
train/dia43_utt5,0,Something wrong?
train/dia43_utt6,0,No. Nothing.
train/dia44_utt0,0,And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
train/dia44_utt1,2,Yeah, that's it?
train/dia44_utt2,0,Yeah.
train/dia45_utt0,6,Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
train/dia45_utt1,5,No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
train/dia45_utt2,0,It's not that bad.
train/dia45_utt3,4,Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
train/dia45_utt4,0,So, you're just Bing?

train/dia46_utt14,1,No they didn't!
train/dia47_utt0,0,You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
train/dia47_utt1,0,It's gonna be worth it.
train/dia47_utt2,0,It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
train/dia47_utt3,0,Women love guys who love babies.
train/dia47_utt4,0,It's that whole sensitive thing.
train/dia47_utt5,0,Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.

train/dia48_utt0,0,Bye.
train/dia49_utt0,0,Well, not really.
train/dia49_utt1,0,I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
train/dia49_utt2,4,Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
train/dia49_utt3,1,Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
train/dia49_utt4,3,Yeah. What-what should I do?
train/dia49_utt5,0,Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
train/dia49_utt6,0,I mean what's more important?
train/dia49_utt7,0,What people think or how you feel, huh?
train/dia49_utt8,0,Ross, you gotta follow your heart.

train/dia51_utt3,5,I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
train/dia51_utt4,4,For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
train/dia51_utt5,4,You had no
train/dia51_utt6,4,Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
train/dia51_utt7,4,But I told you, I didn't have the time!
train/dia51_utt8,4,Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
train/dia51_utt9,4,Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
train/dia51_utt10,4,You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
train/dia52_utt0,0,I know.
train/dia52_utt1,1,Ooh, I have to tell you something.
train/dia52_utt2,0,What?
train/dia52_utt3,0,But I can't tell you.
train/dia52_utt4,0,Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
train/dia52_utt5,0,Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
train/dia52_utt6,0,Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
train/dia52_utt7,0,No.
train/dia52_utt8,0,Does it have to do with Joey?
train/dia52_utt9,0,No.
train/dia52_utt10,0,Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
train/dia52_utt11,0,No, but let's come back to that later!
train/dia53_utt0,1,Hi!
train/dia53_utt1,1,Richard!
train/dia53_utt2,0,Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
train/dia53_utt3,0,Ohh  Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
train/dia53_utt4,0,Like I have nothing better to do!
train/dia53_utt5,0,So what's up?
train/dia53_utt6,1,Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
train/dia53_utt7,0,Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
train/dia53_utt8,1,No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.
train/dia54_utt0,5,One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
train/dia54_utt1,6,So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?

train/dia54_utt5,0,And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
train/dia54_utt6,1,You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.
train/dia54_utt7,4,Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?
train/dia54_utt8,6,Because!  Cause   Cause you're my baby sister!
train/dia54_utt9,1,And you're my big brother!
train/dia54_utt10,0,I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world.
train/dia54_utt11,0,I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad.
train/dia54_utt12,3,I was scared of telling you.
train/dia54_utt13,3,Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.
train/dia54_utt14,6,Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
train/dia54_utt15,6,I want him to have his uncle.
train/dia54_utt16,6,Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
train/dia54_utt17,1,Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
train/dia54_utt18,1,We're gonna be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
train/dia54_utt19,1,That's right! By his uncle too!
train/dia54_utt20,1,And by you.
train/dia54_utt21,0,Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
train/dia54_utt22,1,Come here!

train/dia66_utt2,0,Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.

train/dia66_utt8,6,Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.

train/dia67_utt7,1,You just saved me!
train/dia67_utt8,1,You're my hero!
train/dia67_utt9,0,Hero, I uh, I don't know well, all right.

train/dia67_utt12,0,No.
train/dia67_utt13,0,No, I won't.
train/dia67_utt14,0,But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
train/dia67_utt15,4,She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
train/dia68_utt0,4,...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
train/dia68_utt1,1,Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.

train/dia69_utt3,2,That's it?
train/dia69_utt4,6,Yeah, it was really hard.
train/dia69_utt5,0,Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
train/dia69_utt6,4,Ok, you weren't there.
train/dia70_utt0,1,Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
train/dia70_utt1,0,Pretty nice?
train/dia70_utt2,0,You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
train/dia70_utt3,0,We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
train/dia70_utt4,0,Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
train/dia70_utt5,4,You gotta take the canoe!
train/dia70_utt6,0,All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
train/dia70_utt7,4,We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
train/dia70_utt8,4,Good for you!!
train/dia71_utt0,0,Pheebs?
train/dia71_utt1,0,Yeah?

train/dia72_utt1,2,One ticket to Yemen?
train/dia72_utt2,0,Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
train/dia72_utt3,2,I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
train/dia72_utt4,0,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
train/dia72_utt5,0,Are you travelling with a child?
train/dia72_utt6,0,No.
train/dia72_utt7,0,All right, y'know what, she's  gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
train/dia73_utt0,0,Okay, but this is the last time.

train/dia80_utt5,0,Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
train/dia81_utt0,0,OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
train/dia81_utt1,0,About what?
train/dia81_utt2,0,He's planning your birthday party.
train/dia81_utt3,1,Oh my God! I love him!

train/dia81_utt10,0,Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
train/dia81_utt11,4,This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
train/dia81_utt12,0,No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
train/dia81_utt13,4,Yuh-huh!
train/dia81_utt14,4,I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
train/dia81_utt15,4,I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
train/dia81_utt16,2,Looks like I was second to last.
train/dia82_utt0,0,Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
train/dia82_utt1,0,Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
train/dia82_utt2,4,Chandler! He's your father.  he should be at the wedding.
train/dia82_utt3,5,I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not that close. I haven't seen him in years.
train/dia82_utt4,6,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
train/dia82_utt5,0,It's not like we run in the same circles.
train/dia82_utt6,5,I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
train/dia82_utt7,0,Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
train/dia82_utt9,5,Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
train/dia82_utt10,0,So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
train/dia82_utt11,0,Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
train/dia83_utt0,0,Hello! Who's in there?
train/dia83_utt1,0,How ya doin'?
train/dia83_utt2,4,Who in the hell are you?

train/dia84_utt0,3,No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
train/dia84_utt1,4,No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
train/dia84_utt2,4,I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
train/dia84_utt3,4,Not after this!
train/dia84_utt4,0,Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.

train/dia85_utt1,0,Okay.
train/dia85_utt2,0,So Pheebs, what is the book about?

train/dia86_utt1,0,Y'know what, actually   Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
train/dia86_utt2,2,I thought you didn't smoke.
train/dia86_utt3,0,Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
train/dia86_utt4,0,Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
train/dia86_utt5,2,And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
train/dia86_utt6,0,But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
train/dia86_utt7,0,We get high.
train/dia86_utt8,0,Oh, me too.

train/dia87_utt5,0,Hi.
train/dia87_utt6,0,Hey, how'd it go?
train/dia87_utt7,1,Excellent.
train/dia87_utt8,1,We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
train/dia87_utt9,1,What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
train/dia88_utt0,0,You know what? You are right. I

train/dia89_utt2,1,Hi!
train/dia89_utt4,0,Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
train/dia89_utt5,0,Handling it?
train/dia89_utt6,1,What do you mean, handling it?
train/dia89_utt7,1,There's nothing to handle.
train/dia89_utt8,0,Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
train/dia89_utt9,4,Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
train/dia89_utt10,2,What?
train/dia89_utt11,4,Come on!
train/dia89_utt12,5,They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous!
train/dia89_utt15,0,And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off.
train/dia89_utt16,1,I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
train/dia90_utt0,2,What the hell is this?!
train/dia91_utt0,4,What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?!
train/dia92_utt0,4,This sucks!
train/dia92_utt1,0,All right, what's my next present?
train/dia93_utt0,0,All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?

train/dia112_utt2,4,Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
train/dia112_utt3,4,Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
train/dia112_utt4,5,The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle beer! Cold beer.
train/dia113_utt0,0,Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
train/dia113_utt1,4,Do you always have to bring him here?
train/dia113_utt2,0,I didn't wanna leave him alone.
train/dia113_utt3,0,Alright?
train/dia113_utt4,0,We- we had our first fight this morning.
train/dia113_utt5,0,I think it has to do with my working late.
train/dia113_utt6,0,I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
train/dia113_utt7,0,Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
train/dia113_utt8,1,Oh, that'd be great!
train/dia113_utt9,0,Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
train/dia113_utt10,0,Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
train/dia114_utt0,0,Check this out.
train/dia114_utt1,2,It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
train/dia114_utt2,0,"It's almost as good as being there."
train/dia114_utt3,1,It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
train/dia114_utt4,1,Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
train/dia115_utt0,0,Uh, may I help you?
train/dia115_utt1,0,Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
train/dia115_utt2,0,Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
train/dia115_utt3,0,All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
train/dia115_utt4,4,Nobody sees the king!
train/dia115_utt5,0,Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
train/dia115_utt6,2,Hey! You can't go back there!
train/dia115_utt7,2,Oh my God.
train/dia116_utt0,0,So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?
train/dia116_utt1,0,I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
train/dia116_utt2,6,Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
train/dia116_utt3,2,Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
train/dia116_utt4,0,Yeah.
train/dia116_utt5,0,My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
train/dia116_utt6,0,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
train/dia116_utt7,6,No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
train/dia117_utt0,1,Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
train/dia117_utt1,0,Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.

train/dia117_utt3,0,No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
train/dia118_utt0,0,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
train/dia118_utt1,2,And now you want that money back.
train/dia118_utt2,0,Exactly.
train/dia118_utt3,1,Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
train/dia118_utt4,4,It's not a real game! I made it up!
train/dia118_utt5,1,I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
train/dia119_utt0,0,I don't know.
train/dia119_utt1,0,But I can see through your sheet.
train/dia119_utt2,0,Yeah, yeah, that's her.
train/dia119_utt3,0,But y'know what?
train/dia119_utt4,6,Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
train/dia119_utt5,0,Why?
train/dia119_utt6,6,Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
train/dia119_utt7,2,What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
train/dia119_utt8,0,No. No. No. She lives on the

train/dia122_utt1,3,You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
train/dia122_utt2,0,Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.

train/dia122_utt4,0,Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given'  em out.

train/dia123_utt4,4,It's not funny!
train/dia123_utt5,0,I respectfully disagree.
train/dia123_utt6,4,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
train/dia123_utt7,0,Who cares? Nobody reads those things
train/dia123_utt8,4,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.

train/dia148_utt17,4,Aw, I know all about Kip!
train/dia148_utt18,4,It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
train/dia148_utt19,6,Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
train/dia148_utt20,6,Aw, don't do that

train/dia164_utt3,0,I did.
train/dia164_utt4,6,Oh.
train/dia164_utt5,3,Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?

train/dia164_utt8,1,Yeah, maybe...
train/dia164_utt9,1,Okay... okay, maybe I will...

train/dia165_utt1,1,Well, you're amazing.
train/dia165_utt2,0,Oh no-no-no.
train/dia165_utt3,2,A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
train/dia165_utt4,0,Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.

train/dia167_utt1,2,Wow! This girl is good.
train/dia167_utt2,4,Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
train/dia167_utt3,0,I like her.
train/dia167_utt4,0,Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
train/dia167_utt5,0,Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
train/dia167_utt6,4,Look at you. All jealous.
train/dia167_utt7,0,Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more

train/dia168_utt9,4,Ross, no! There is
train/dia168_utt10,0,Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
train/dia168_utt11,4,Ross, I am a human doodle!!
train/dia168_utt12,0,Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!

train/dia170_utt5,0,Oh right, right.
train/dia170_utt6,5,I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?

train/dia170_utt8,0,Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
train/dia170_utt9,0,Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
train/dia170_utt10,6,I'm such a jerk.
train/dia170_utt11,0,It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
train/dia171_utt0,1,Hmmm... this is so nice.
train/dia171_utt1,0,OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.

train/dia174_utt3,1,Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
train/dia174_utt4,0,Actually I do have one small complaint.
train/dia174_utt5,0,Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
train/dia174_utt6,6,The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
train/dia174_utt7,2,What musician?
train/dia175_utt0,0,We did?
train/dia175_utt1,1,You owe me 20 bucks.
train/dia175_utt2,1,Thank you. Thank you so much!
train/dia175_utt3,0,Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
train/dia175_utt4,2,Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
train/dia175_utt5,4,What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
train/dia175_utt6,0,All right, I'm nine years old.
train/dia175_utt7,6,Oh, I hate this story.
train/dia175_utt8,0,We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
train/dia175_utt9,6,I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
train/dia175_utt10,2,Oh my god.
train/dia175_utt11,6,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
train/dia176_utt0,2,Hey, who's this little naked guy?
train/dia176_utt1,0,That little naked guy would be me.
train/dia176_utt2,2,Aww, look at the little thing.
train/dia176_utt4,2,Who are those people?
train/dia176_utt5,2,Got me.
train/dia176_utt6,0,Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.

train/dia176_utt9,0,Looks like a fun gang.
train/dia176_utt10,1,Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
train/dia177_utt0,1,So, what's this about?
train/dia177_utt1,0,Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
train/dia177_utt2,0,No.  This is my red sweater.
train/dia177_utt3,3,Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
train/dia177_utt4,1,What's going on Rach?
train/dia177_utt5,3,Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
train/dia177_utt6,1,Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called.
train/dia177_utt7,1,I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together.
train/dia177_utt8,6,Oh, it's just not the right time.
train/dia177_utt9,1,It is the right time.

train/dia180_utt12,0,It's you. This is yours.
train/dia180_utt13,2,What?!
train/dia180_utt14,1,Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
train/dia180_utt15,3,That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
train/dia181_utt0,4,Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
train/dia181_utt1,0,Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here.

train/dia182_utt6,4,Oh God, stop with the plan!
train/dia182_utt7,0,So what, so what you saw him with a girl?
train/dia182_utt8,4,Who cares?!
train/dia182_utt9,4,That doesn't mean anything!
train/dia182_utt10,0,Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
train/dia182_utt11,0,She was kinda stupid.
train/dia182_utt12,0,You're right.
train/dia182_utt13,0,All right, I'm just gonna go on the date.

train/dia184_utt16,4,I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
train/dia184_utt17,4,Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??
train/dia184_utt18,0,Yeah...
train/dia184_utt19,4,And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?

train/dia185_utt2,2,Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
train/dia185_utt3,0,Remembered what?
train/dia185_utt4,2,It was like months ago.
train/dia185_utt5,6,We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
train/dia185_utt6,2,Oh!
train/dia185_utt7,2,I can't believe he remembered!
train/dia185_utt8,2,Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
train/dia185_utt9,2,I can't believe he did this.
train/dia185_utt10,0,Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
train/dia185_utt11,2,What did you just say?
train/dia185_utt12,3,F-hah.... flennin....

train/dia186_utt4,0,Wait, just a second.
train/dia186_utt5,2,Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
train/dia187_utt0,6,Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from

train/dia187_utt3,2,This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  You're Bonnie?
train/dia187_utt4,0,I can show you an ID if you want?
train/dia187_utt5,2,Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
train/dia187_utt6,0,Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.

train/dia189_utt0,3,I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
train/dia189_utt1,0,Maybe we should check the trash chute.
train/dia189_utt2,0,Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
train/dia189_utt3,0,That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
train/dia189_utt4,0,Hey!
train/dia189_utt5,1,There he is!

train/dia192_utt0,6,Well, the old lady died.
train/dia192_utt1,0,And how do I know?

train/dia193_utt1,1,Wow, that's great.
train/dia193_utt2,1,Oh, yeah!
train/dia193_utt3,0,Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
train/dia193_utt4,0,I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
train/dia193_utt5,2,What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
train/dia193_utt6,0,Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know.
train/dia193_utt7,0,You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
train/dia194_utt0,0,Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
train/dia194_utt1,1,That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up.

train/dia195_utt10,0,Yeah, maybe.
train/dia195_utt11,5,Oh-oh, you lie.
train/dia195_utt12,0,What you don't think I'd go up to her?
train/dia195_utt13,0,Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
train/dia195_utt14,4,Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
train/dia195_utt15,0,You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.

train/dia199_utt0,6,Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
train/dia199_utt1,1,Oh that's all right!
train/dia199_utt2,1,Y'know, I ended up having a really good time.
train/dia199_utt3,1,Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
train/dia199_utt4,0,So what was it for anyway?
train/dia199_utt5,0,I wanna say a disease.
train/dia199_utt6,2,Hey!
train/dia199_utt7,2,Hey!
train/dia199_utt8,0,I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on
train/dia199_utt9,2,Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
train/dia199_utt10,0,Oh-oh Professor Geller.
train/dia199_utt11,0,Ahh, to be 13 again.

train/dia200_utt2,2,What?!
train/dia200_utt3,2,I know!
train/dia200_utt4,4,I can't believe it.  Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
train/dia200_utt5,4,Can I tell you something? Me too.
train/dia200_utt6,4,Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him
train/dia200_utt7,1,Ooooh! Freeze him out.
train/dia200_utt8,1,That's right!
train/dia200_utt9,1,I like it!
train/dia201_utt0,0,Doorknob?
train/dia201_utt1,0,Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
train/dia201_utt2,1,Oh good.
train/dia201_utt3,3,Look, I   Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.
train/dia201_utt4,6,So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet.
train/dia201_utt5,3,It's-it's too soon.
train/dia201_utt6,2,Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
train/dia201_utt7,2,No. I think you misunderstood what
train/dia201_utt8,1,You are so adorable.
train/dia201_utt9,1,That! Let's talk about that.
train/dia202_utt0,1,Hey!
train/dia202_utt1,0,How do you feel?
train/dia202_utt2,0,Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
train/dia202_utt3,0,Okay, so I
train/dia202_utt4,0,And protected them from a tornado?
train/dia202_utt5,2,Oh my God.
train/dia202_utt6,0,I know, the babies are asleep.
train/dia202_utt7,2,Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
train/dia202_utt8,1,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
train/dia202_utt9,2,But my apartment!
train/dia202_utt12,0,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
train/dia202_utt13,0,You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out.
train/dia202_utt14,0, Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
train/dia202_utt15,0,When will that be?
train/dia202_utt16,4,Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
train/dia203_utt0,1,Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
train/dia203_utt1,2,What?! It is?!
train/dia203_utt2,1,It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
train/dia203_utt3,1,Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
train/dia203_utt4,1,Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping
train/dia203_utt5,0,A dreamless sleep.
train/dia204_utt0,1,So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
train/dia204_utt1,0,Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
train/dia204_utt2,0,Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
train/dia204_utt3,0,Okay.
train/dia204_utt4,0,When are you coming home?
train/dia204_utt5,2,What? Guys, I'm not.
train/dia204_utt6,0,C'mon, this is us.
train/dia204_utt7,0,I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
train/dia204_utt8,2,Waitressing?
train/dia204_utt9,0,Okay, I'm not just waitressing.
train/dia204_utt10,0,I'm..
train/dia204_utt11,0,I, um...
train/dia204_utt12,0,I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...
train/dia204_utt13,6,I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

train/dia207_utt2,2,Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
train/dia207_utt3,0,Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
train/dia207_utt4,0,Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.

train/dia207_utt11,1,Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
train/dia207_utt12,0,So you're a chef?
train/dia207_utt13,1,I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.

train/dia207_utt15,0,Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
train/dia207_utt16,0,Well, I was having a conversation.
train/dia207_utt17,4,Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
train/dia207_utt18,4,What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
train/dia207_utt19,0,That would be great. Thank you.
train/dia208_utt0,5,so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
train/dia208_utt1,0,Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
train/dia208_utt2,2,When did that happen to you?!
train/dia208_utt3,0,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture I didn't have my camera!
train/dia208_utt4,5,Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
train/dia208_utt5,1,Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
train/dia208_utt6,4,Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
train/dia208_utt7,0,Here, I'll get it.

train/dia208_utt9,1,Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
train/dia208_utt10,2,Oh, great!
train/dia208_utt11,1,Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!

train/dia210_utt8,1,Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
train/dia210_utt9,0,Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
train/dia210_utt10,0,I know.
train/dia211_utt0,1,So Chandler, your parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
train/dia211_utt1,0,Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
train/dia211_utt2,1,I remember when we first got engaged.
train/dia211_utt3,0,Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
train/dia211_utt5,1,Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know how that happened.
train/dia211_utt6,5,You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
train/dia211_utt7,0,What a sweet story.
train/dia211_utt8,5,Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
train/dia211_utt9,2,What?! They wanted a scary story!
train/dia211_utt10,1,Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
train/dia211_utt11,2,What?
train/dia211_utt12,3,You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
train/dia211_utt13,2,What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
train/dia211_utt14,0,We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
train/dia212_utt0,0,After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
train/dia212_utt1,1,Did that!
train/dia212_utt2,0,Grasp one of the linen strips by its  easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
train/dia212_utt3,2,Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
train/dia212_utt4,2,Was it not pain-free?
train/dia212_utt5,5,No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
train/dia212_utt6,0,Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
train/dia212_utt7,4,That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
train/dia212_utt8,0,But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
train/dia212_utt9,2,Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!

train/dia236_utt7,0,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
train/dia236_utt9,0,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
train/dia236_utt10,0,They're all tourists.
train/dia236_utt11,5,All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
train/dia236_utt12,0,Oh yeah?  If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
train/dia236_utt13,4,Good choice.
train/dia236_utt14,1,Thanks.
train/dia236_utt15,4,Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
train/dia237_utt0,2,So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
train/dia237_utt1,2,What?
train/dia237_utt2,4,Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
train/dia237_utt3,0,And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my
train/dia237_utt4,2,Whoa, whoa, whoa.
train/dia237_utt5,4,You don't even know me...
train/dia237_utt6,2,Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
train/dia237_utt7,2,What?
train/dia237_utt8,6,The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
train/dia237_utt9,6,I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
train/dia237_utt10,0,No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
train/dia237_utt11,0,Oh yeah.
train/dia238_utt0,0,Okay, forward. Forward Stop!  Okay, back Stop!  Okay, forward Stop! Stop! Stop!
train/dia238_utt1,0,Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
train/dia238_utt2,0,Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.
train/dia238_utt3,0,You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
train/dia238_utt4,0,Okay?
train/dia238_utt5,0,All right, here we go.
train/dia238_utt6,0,Haul ass!!!
train/dia239_utt0,0,So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
train/dia239_utt1,0,So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
train/dia239_utt2,1,...and live forever as a machine!
train/dia239_utt3,1,That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
train/dia239_utt4,0,You and I, we're interfacing.
train/dia239_utt5,3,Yeah, I gotta go.
train/dia239_utt6,1,Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
train/dia240_utt0,0,David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
train/dia240_utt1,0,Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
train/dia240_utt2,0,See?
train/dia240_utt3,3,Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
train/dia240_utt4,0,Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
train/dia240_utt5,0,Oh, I should go, too.
train/dia240_utt6,0,Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
train/dia241_utt0,4,Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
train/dia241_utt1,6,And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
train/dia241_utt2,0,I asked him.
train/dia241_utt3,4,He's totally ok with seeing you!".
train/dia241_utt4,1,So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
train/dia241_utt5,4,Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
train/dia241_utt6,0,Exactly!
train/dia241_utt7,0,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
train/dia241_utt8,4,I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,
train/dia241_utt9,0,Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
train/dia241_utt10,1,Ok, that'll be great!
train/dia241_utt11,5,Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
train/dia241_utt12,5,That's not what we're gonna do!
train/dia241_utt13,5,Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
train/dia242_utt0,1,Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
train/dia242_utt1,0,Hello Skidmark.
train/dia242_utt2,0,It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
train/dia242_utt3,0,It's pretty clear.
train/dia242_utt4,0,Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
train/dia242_utt5,2,That's why you broke up with me?
train/dia242_utt6,6,You-you-you didn't know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
train/dia243_utt0,1,Ni-chou chi-ma!
train/dia243_utt1,2,Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
train/dia244_utt0,0,Hi everyone.
train/dia244_utt1,0,I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
train/dia244_utt3,0,Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
train/dia244_utt4,3,What did, what did he say?
train/dia244_utt5,0,Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
train/dia244_utt6,0,So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
train/dia245_utt0,1,Oh, great!
train/dia245_utt1,1,We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
train/dia245_utt2,1,Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
train/dia245_utt3,1,All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
train/dia245_utt4,0,And did he?
train/dia245_utt5,1,I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
train/dia245_utt6,0,Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
train/dia245_utt7,1,I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
train/dia245_utt8,1,Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
train/dia245_utt9,6,Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
train/dia245_utt10,5,You sound like a guy.
train/dia245_utt11,5,No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
train/dia245_utt12,2,Oh my God!
train/dia245_utt13,6,I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
train/dia245_utt14,2,I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up!
train/dia245_utt15,6,I mean, I I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
train/dia245_utt16,0,You'll have a last kiss.
train/dia246_utt0,1,Thank you so much for coming back over.
train/dia246_utt1,6,Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
train/dia246_utt2,0,I know Mona, just hear me out.
train/dia246_utt3,0,First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
train/dia246_utt4,0,You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
train/dia246_utt5,0,Focus.
train/dia246_utt6,0,Okay. Um But Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
train/dia247_utt0,0,All right where's that turkey!
train/dia247_utt1,2,Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
train/dia247_utt2,1,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
train/dia248_utt0,0,No.
train/dia248_utt1,4,No!
train/dia248_utt3,1,Oh, would you look at that Monica?
train/dia248_utt4,1,I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
train/dia248_utt5,4,Okay, I'm next.  Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
train/dia248_utt6,1,Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
train/dia248_utt7,4,Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
train/dia249_utt0,0,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
train/dia249_utt1,0,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
train/dia249_utt2,0,Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
train/dia249_utt3,1,But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
train/dia249_utt4,6,I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
train/dia249_utt5,6,Or Friday with no two pizzas!
train/dia249_utt6,6,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just there's gonna be a ton left over.
train/dia249_utt7,1,No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
train/dia249_utt8,0,All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
train/dia249_utt9,1,That's right!
train/dia249_utt10,1, Cause I'm a Tribbiani!
train/dia249_utt11,0,And this is what we do!
train/dia249_utt13,1,We can eat!
train/dia250_utt0,2,Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
train/dia250_utt1,1,Look at this!
train/dia250_utt2,2,Oh! You have a window!
train/dia250_utt3,1,Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
train/dia250_utt4,2,Oh look! That guy's peeing!
train/dia250_utt5,0,Hi.
train/dia250_utt6,0,Hi.
train/dia251_utt0,4,Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
train/dia251_utt1,0,Okay. Let's use this brush.
train/dia251_utt2,0,Okay. This stuff?
train/dia251_utt3,0,Yeah.
train/dia251_utt4,0,All right.
train/dia251_utt5,0,Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
train/dia251_utt6,6,Okay-Dokey
train/dia252_utt0,0,Where exactly is your zoo?
train/dia252_utt1,0,Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
train/dia252_utt2,0,Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
train/dia252_utt3,0,Yes.
train/dia252_utt4,0,Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
train/dia252_utt5,0,No-no, he's, he's very docile.
train/dia252_utt6,0,Even if he were... cornered?
train/dia252_utt7,0,Well I, I don't know. Why?
train/dia252_utt8,0,Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
train/dia252_utt9,0,He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
train/dia252_utt10,0,How about a hammer, or a small blade?
train/dia252_utt13,0,Otherwise it's just cruel.
train/dia252_utt14,1,He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
train/dia252_utt15,0,We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
train/dia252_utt16,0,...He's in.
train/dia252_utt17,1,He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
train/dia252_utt18,5,You're making a big mistake here.
train/dia252_utt19,0,I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
train/dia253_utt0,0,My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
train/dia253_utt1,1,Really helped speed the process along!
train/dia253_utt2,2,Janice!
train/dia253_utt3,2,You're not... gone?
train/dia253_utt4,0,Sid is still in his room.
train/dia253_utt5,1,I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
train/dia253_utt6,2,So did you do it?
train/dia253_utt7,0,Did you make your deposit?
train/dia253_utt8,1,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
train/dia253_utt9,3,That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
train/dia253_utt10,1,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
train/dia253_utt11,0,Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
train/dia254_utt0,3,Phoebe, where's your purse?
train/dia254_utt1,4,No, no! Give it to me!
train/dia254_utt2,4,You can't have it.
train/dia254_utt3,4,Give it to me!
train/dia254_utt4,4,No
train/dia254_utt5,4,I'll go in there.
train/dia254_utt6,4,Oh yeah.
train/dia254_utt7,0,Phoebe come here
train/dia254_utt8,1,Haha!
train/dia254_utt9,4,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
train/dia255_utt0,5,What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
train/dia255_utt1,0,I just had sex.
train/dia255_utt2,2,Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
train/dia255_utt3,0,Well, you never told me how old you were.
train/dia255_utt4,5,Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
train/dia255_utt5,1,I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
train/dia255_utt6,3,Don't say it.
train/dia255_utt7,1,...in love with you.
train/dia255_utt8,2,Really?
train/dia255_utt9,6,Sorry.
train/dia255_utt10,4,Well,fall out of it.
train/dia255_utt11,4,You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.
train/dia255_utt12,1,Oh god, oh god.
train/dia255_utt13,5,I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
train/dia255_utt14,5,I'm Joan Collins.
train/dia255_utt15,0,Who?
train/dia256_utt0,6,That's right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
train/dia256_utt1,0,Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
train/dia256_utt2,4,You. Like you haven't done enough.
train/dia256_utt3,0,Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
train/dia256_utt4,0,I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
train/dia256_utt5,0,Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies.
train/dia256_utt6,4,And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.
train/dia256_utt7,1,God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
train/dia256_utt8,0,Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end
train/dia256_utt9,0,Oh Phoebe, that's a great story.
train/dia256_utt10,6,Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?
train/dia256_utt11,4,Oh God, get out!
train/dia256_utt12,4,Get out!!
train/dia256_utt13,4,Get out!!
train/dia256_utt14,4,Get out!
train/dia256_utt15,0,Let's.
train/dia257_utt0,1,All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
train/dia257_utt1,3,Oh my God .What's he gonna do now?
train/dia257_utt2,3,I can't watch!
train/dia257_utt3,0,Oh.
train/dia257_utt4,6,Seriously, how can you watch this?
train/dia257_utt5,3,Aren't you scared?
train/dia257_utt6,3,Terrified.
train/dia258_utt0,1,Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
train/dia258_utt1,0,Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
train/dia258_utt2,2,Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?
train/dia258_utt3,0,Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.
train/dia258_utt4,0,I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
train/dia258_utt5,0,Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I
train/dia258_utt6,1,Fine! Maybe I will too!
train/dia259_utt0,3,Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
train/dia259_utt1,3,You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
train/dia259_utt2,4,MY SANDWICH?!!!
train/dia259_utt3,4,MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
train/dia260_utt0,0,What's the matter, Pheebs?
train/dia260_utt1,4,She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
train/dia260_utt2,2,What?!
train/dia260_utt3,6,Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
train/dia260_utt4,6,She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is.
train/dia260_utt5,6,She knows, and she won't tell me.
train/dia260_utt6,6,Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
train/dia260_utt7,6,Yeah, well, don't  Aww Pheebs, that sucks!  me yet.
train/dia260_utt8,0,Where ya going?
train/dia260_utt9,0,Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
train/dia260_utt10,3,Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
train/dia260_utt11,4,Well, are any of those people here?!
train/dia261_utt0,2,Oh my God, so do I!
train/dia261_utt1,2,I knew it, wow!!
train/dia261_utt2,0,Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
train/dia261_utt3,1,Ohh, so cute.
train/dia261_utt4,4,Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
train/dia261_utt5,4,I know. I'm mad at me too.
train/dia261_utt6,0,Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
train/dia261_utt7,2,Hey! Me too!
train/dia261_utt8,6,All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
train/dia262_utt0,0,Ok, you can do this.
train/dia262_utt1,0,It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
train/dia262_utt2,0,Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
train/dia262_utt3,6,Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
train/dia262_utt4,4,All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
train/dia263_utt0,2,Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
train/dia263_utt1,2,Really?  My God, he's really cute.
train/dia263_utt2,0,Go for it.
train/dia263_utt3,2,Phoebe, I'm engaged!
train/dia263_utt4,0,I'm just saying, get his number just in case.
train/dia263_utt5,0,But no: Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
train/dia263_utt6,1,Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
train/dia263_utt7,5,Well you should be embarrassed.
train/dia263_utt8,1,I did, but that was really fun.
train/dia264_utt0,0,Hey.
train/dia264_utt1,0,Chandler. I sensed it was you.
train/dia264_utt2,2,What?!
train/dia264_utt3,0,Unagi. I'm always aware.
train/dia264_utt4,1,Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
train/dia264_utt5,0,What's up?
train/dia264_utt6,0,I can't figure out what to make Monica.
train/dia264_utt7,4,Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
train/dia264_utt8,3,I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
train/dia264_utt9,0,Y'know what?
train/dia264_utt10,0,She'd-she'd love this.
train/dia264_utt11,0,Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8.
train/dia264_utt12,0,I made it in the sixth grade.
train/dia264_utt13,0,Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
train/dia264_utt14,0,Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.
train/dia264_utt15,1,But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
train/dia264_utt16,0,Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
train/dia264_utt17,0,Why not?
train/dia264_utt18,0,Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
train/dia265_utt0,4,Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
train/dia265_utt1,0,He might still show up.
train/dia265_utt2,4,Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
train/dia265_utt3,0,Is that all?
train/dia265_utt4,6,I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
train/dia266_utt0,0,Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
train/dia267_utt0,0,Um, it's going to be a small ceremony.
train/dia268_utt0,2,Uh, tiny!
train/dia268_utt1,0,We're not even sure why we're having it.
train/dia269_utt0,0,It's actually going to be just family.
train/dia269_utt1,2,Oh wait you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing
train/dia270_utt0,0,Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
train/dia270_utt1,1,Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
train/dia270_utt2,1,Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
train/dia270_utt3,0,Well, I brought the next best thing.
train/dia271_utt0,2,Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
train/dia271_utt1,1,Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
train/dia271_utt2,1,Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
train/dia271_utt3,1,You're so sweet!
train/dia271_utt4,1,Ohh, you're so sweet!
train/dia271_utt5,2,Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
train/dia271_utt6,0,Huh.
train/dia271_utt7,0,Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
train/dia271_utt8,0,Uhh .
train/dia271_utt9,4,You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
train/dia271_utt10,0,Nah.
train/dia272_utt0,3,How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape , a rapist or a killer or something!
train/dia272_utt1,2,Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
train/dia272_utt2,4,Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!

train/dia273_utt2,6,It's so hard!
train/dia273_utt3,6,Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a ah-ah!
train/dia273_utt4,6,Paper cut!
train/dia273_utt5,0,Now, have you told anyone else?
train/dia273_utt6,0,No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
train/dia273_utt7,2,You told me.
train/dia273_utt8,4,Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
train/dia273_utt9,2,Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
train/dia273_utt10,0,Me too.

train/dia274_utt1,2,What?
train/dia274_utt2,2,The ring is gone!
train/dia274_utt3,5,Ugh.
train/dia274_utt4,0,Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this Ah-ha-ha!!
train/dia274_utt5,1,You lost the ring!
train/dia274_utt6,4,You're the worst best man ever!
train/dia274_utt7,4,Dude, this isn't funny!
train/dia274_utt8,3,What am I gonna do?!
train/dia274_utt9,1,I go to bed last night, everything's cool!
train/dia274_utt10,3,I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
train/dia274_utt11,2,You slept with the stripper?
train/dia274_utt12,3,Of course!!
train/dia275_utt0,4,What difference does that make?!
train/dia275_utt1,4,Well, I'm just if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
train/dia275_utt2,0,Joey, do you have a minute?
train/dia275_utt3,3,Dude, what am I gonna
train/dia275_utt4,4,Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
train/dia275_utt5,3,Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
train/dia275_utt6,0,Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
train/dia275_utt7,0,Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
train/dia275_utt8,0,What-what is it, what is it?
train/dia275_utt9,2,Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
train/dia275_utt10,3,Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
train/dia275_utt11,4,Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
train/dia275_utt12,5,I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
train/dia275_utt13,2,What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
train/dia275_utt14,5,And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
train/dia275_utt15,3,I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
train/dia275_utt16,4,I'm not listening to you!
train/dia276_utt0,1,Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
train/dia276_utt2,4,Hey, come on now!
train/dia276_utt3,0,All right, what are we havin'?
train/dia277_utt0,0,Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.
train/dia277_utt1,0,I'll take those to go.  For the kids.
train/dia277_utt2,0,Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
train/dia277_utt3,4,It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said.
train/dia277_utt4,0,But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.
train/dia277_utt5,0,Understood. So, what'd you say back then?
train/dia277_utt6,0,Well, I said that I
train/dia278_utt0,0,Ha!
train/dia278_utt1,1,So you like the drums!
train/dia278_utt2,1,That's, that's great!
train/dia278_utt3,0,Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.
train/dia278_utt4,6,All right, okay, well, apparently not!
train/dia278_utt5,1,So, yay!
train/dia278_utt6,0,Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
train/dia278_utt7,1,Tequila!!
train/dia278_utt8,1,That's fun.
train/dia279_utt0,2,Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
train/dia279_utt1,6,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
train/dia279_utt2,4,I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
train/dia279_utt3,3,Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
train/dia279_utt4,4,That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
train/dia279_utt5,0,All right that's it, school is in session!
train/dia279_utt6,2,My God! Is this a gym card?
train/dia279_utt7,0,Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
train/dia279_utt8,0,So why don't you quit?
train/dia279_utt9,1,You don't think I've tried? You think I
train/dia279_utt10,0,Who is Maria?
train/dia279_utt11,1,Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym treat.
train/dia279_utt12,0,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
train/dia279_utt13,4,No!
train/dia279_utt14,0,So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
train/dia279_utt15,3,Oh no, you'll have to come.
train/dia280_utt0,0,Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
train/dia280_utt1,4,Exactly! Because it's in the past!
train/dia280_utt2,0,Anybody gonna eat that?
train/dia281_utt0,1,Pheebs!
train/dia281_utt1,1,Hey!
train/dia281_utt2,0,Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
train/dia281_utt3,0,Yeah!
train/dia281_utt4,2,Well, when Jake did it I saw that he was wearing women's underwear!
train/dia281_utt5,0,I know. They were mine.
train/dia281_utt6,5,Oh.  No! No wait, that's weird!
train/dia281_utt7,0,No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
train/dia281_utt8,5,That's weird!
train/dia281_utt9,0,I'm wearing his briefs right now.
train/dia281_utt10,2,That's kinda hot.
train/dia282_utt0,1,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
train/dia282_utt1,0,Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
train/dia282_utt2,1,And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
train/dia283_utt0,5,Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
train/dia283_utt1,0,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
train/dia283_utt2,5,Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
train/dia283_utt3,0,I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear!
train/dia283_utt4,0,I don't think you could ever do that.
train/dia283_utt5,0,Hey! I
train/dia283_utt6,5,Okay, whatever.
train/dia284_utt0,0,Lusts of the flesh.
train/dia284_utt1,0,What?
train/dia284_utt2,0,I don't know.  A cowboy theme?
train/dia285_utt0,0,Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
train/dia285_utt1,1,Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!
train/dia285_utt2,0,Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
train/dia285_utt3,1,Hey!
train/dia285_utt4,0,Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
train/dia285_utt5,0,Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my  breast?
train/dia285_utt6,0,It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don't worry. It'll happen.
train/dia285_utt7,4,Yowza
train/dia285_utt8,0,Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.
train/dia285_utt9,2,Dear Lord.
train/dia285_utt10,0,I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
train/dia285_utt11,0,Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that...
train/dia285_utt13,0,Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
train/dia285_utt14,0,She looks scared.
train/dia285_utt15,0,Doesn't she  look scared?
train/dia285_utt16,0,Y'know, I don't really know her.
train/dia286_utt0,0,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
train/dia286_utt1,0,No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
train/dia286_utt2,0,Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
train/dia286_utt3,0,Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
train/dia287_utt0,0,Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
train/dia287_utt1,6,Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
train/dia287_utt2,4,No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.
train/dia287_utt3,0,The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
train/dia287_utt4,4,Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
train/dia287_utt5,0,Pathetic mess?
train/dia287_utt6,0,I know, but come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
train/dia287_utt7,1,I'm thinkin', cha-ching!
train/dia287_utt8,0,Thanks.
train/dia287_utt9,0,Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
train/dia287_utt10,0,You're doin' this.
train/dia287_utt11,0,Hi. She said yes.
train/dia287_utt12,1,Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
train/dia288_utt0,1,"Happy birthday to you!"
train/dia288_utt1,0,You're paying for that.
train/dia288_utt2,2,What? No-no it's her birthday!
train/dia288_utt3,2,You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
train/dia288_utt4,0,But it really
train/dia288_utt5,0,You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
train/dia288_utt6,4,Damnit!
train/dia288_utt7,1,Rach? Hi!
train/dia288_utt8,1,Hi!
train/dia288_utt9,0,Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
train/dia288_utt10,0,Well yeah
train/dia288_utt11,2,Oh wow!
train/dia288_utt12,2,I mean, wow!
train/dia288_utt13,0,I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
train/dia288_utt14,2,Really?!
train/dia288_utt15,1,Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
train/dia288_utt16,0,Oh so-so not really never.
train/dia288_utt17,0,I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
train/dia288_utt18,0,I mean after all we've been through, I just y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
train/dia288_utt19,0,Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
train/dia288_utt20,1,Oh-ho, and mine!
train/dia289_utt1,3,No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
train/dia289_utt2,0,Well I only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
train/dia289_utt3,6,Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
train/dia289_utt4,6,It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
train/dia289_utt5,0,Chandler?
train/dia290_utt0,6,I-I'm sorry?
train/dia291_utt0,6,No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
train/dia291_utt1,6,Oh yeah?
train/dia292_utt0,0,I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
train/dia292_utt1,6,I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk.
train/dia292_utt2,0,Hang-hang on.
train/dia292_utt3,0,Hey everybody!
train/dia292_utt4,6,Uh, I'm gonna kill myself!
train/dia292_utt5,0,I got nothing.
train/dia293_utt0,2,Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!
train/dia293_utt1,2,I didn't know he could get me fired!
train/dia293_utt2,3,What am I going to do?
train/dia293_utt3,0,Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
train/dia293_utt4,3,Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
train/dia293_utt5,0,No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
train/dia293_utt6,0,That's not a bad idea.
train/dia293_utt7,0,Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.
train/dia293_utt8,1,Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
train/dia293_utt9,0,So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
train/dia293_utt10,6,Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
train/dia293_utt11,0,Yeah, you wish.
train/dia293_utt12,1,"You wish."
train/dia294_utt0,1,Why are you yelling?
train/dia294_utt1,0,Whoa, that
train/dia295_utt0,2,Whoa-whoa, what is it?
train/dia295_utt1,0,Well  It's a date.
train/dia295_utt2,2,A date?!
train/dia295_utt3,2,No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
train/dia295_utt4,6,Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
train/dia295_utt5,4,No, I'm gonna!!
train/dia295_utt6,4,That's right!
train/dia295_utt7,4,Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl!
train/dia295_utt8,4,Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!
train/dia295_utt9,4,And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!

train/dia356_utt9,6,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
train/dia356_utt10,4,Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
train/dia356_utt11,2,What is this? Fruit?

train/dia357_utt1,2,Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
train/dia357_utt2,0,Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
train/dia357_utt3,2,What? Mine aren't tinted.
train/dia358_utt0,0,Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
train/dia358_utt1,0,I will have one.
train/dia358_utt2,0,Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
train/dia358_utt3,6,No, no, it's just my tooth.
train/dia358_utt4,0,All right I'll have one.
train/dia358_utt5,0,So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
train/dia358_utt6,3,No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
train/dia358_utt7,0,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
train/dia358_utt8,2,Why? Why can't you go to him?
train/dia358_utt9,4,Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
train/dia358_utt10,1,That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
train/dia358_utt11,2,Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
train/dia358_utt12,0,Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend  Albino Bob'.
train/dia358_utt13,2,And all these people actually died?
train/dia358_utt14,6,Yes, while I was in the chair!
train/dia358_utt15,0,That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
train/dia358_utt16,0,Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
train/dia358_utt17,0,It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
train/dia358_utt18,6,Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
train/dia359_utt0,2,Hello?
train/dia359_utt1,0,Ross.

train/dia359_utt4,1,No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
train/dia359_utt5,1,Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
train/dia359_utt6,6,Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
train/dia360_utt0,6,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
train/dia360_utt1,6,Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
train/dia360_utt2,0,So, let's go.
train/dia360_utt3,0,Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
train/dia360_utt4,0,Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
train/dia360_utt5,0,You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
train/dia361_utt0,0,Okay, I've got three of my five.
train/dia361_utt1,0,Three of your five, what?
train/dia361_utt2,0,Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.

train/dia361_utt6,1,Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
train/dia361_utt7,2,Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
train/dia361_utt8,0,Susan Sarandon.
train/dia361_utt9,5,Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
train/dia361_utt10,1,And!! Isabella Rosselini.
train/dia361_utt11,1,Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
train/dia361_utt12,0,So?
train/dia361_utt13,0,So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
train/dia361_utt14,0,Yeah,  cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
train/dia362_utt0,6,Oh that's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?
train/dia362_utt1,0,Y'know what I think it is?
train/dia362_utt2,0,I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
train/dia362_utt3,6,Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
train/dia362_utt4,0,Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.

train/dia424_utt5,0,Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.
train/dia424_utt6,0,But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.
train/dia424_utt7,0,Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's
train/dia424_utt8,0,If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?

train/dia424_utt10,0,She lives so close.
train/dia424_utt11,0,And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was if she was kidding was very funny.
train/dia424_utt12,4,On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
train/dia424_utt14,1,Hey!
train/dia424_utt15,1,Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?

train/dia425_utt4,2,What?
train/dia425_utt5,2,There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant.  So I guess she won't be totally alone.

train/dia431_utt10,2,That's not a trip!
train/dia431_utt11,4,I just came from the park!
train/dia431_utt12,4,What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
train/dia431_utt13,4,"Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
train/dia431_utt14,4,Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
train/dia431_utt15,2,Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!
train/dia431_utt16,4,Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just y'know stop it!

train/dia434_utt1,6,It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.
train/dia434_utt2,6,This is hard.
train/dia434_utt3,0,Yeah I know.
train/dia434_utt4,0,On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with.

train/dia446_utt14,4,Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him!
train/dia446_utt15,6,Look, is there something wrong with me?
train/dia446_utt16,6,I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future?
train/dia446_utt17,6,Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on!
train/dia446_utt18,6,I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?
train/dia446_utt19,0,No.
train/dia447_utt0,0,Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
train/dia447_utt1,0,So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,  Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,  remember?
train/dia447_utt2,1,And then, and then, you turn to me and say,  Nah, let's just hang out at your place.  Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
train/dia448_utt0,0,Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
train/dia448_utt1,4,You know what else I'm not gonna miss?
train/dia448_utt2,4,"I'm Monica.
train/dia448_utt3,4,I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
train/dia448_utt4,4,Even if people are on it!"
train/dia448_utt5,4,"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
train/dia448_utt6,4,"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
train/dia448_utt7,1,Hey! I call her!
train/dia448_utt8,4,"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
train/dia448_utt9,4,"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend!
train/dia448_utt10,4,So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
train/dia448_utt11,0,Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
train/dia449_utt0,0,Item J437-A, color: winterberry.
train/dia449_utt1,0,Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
train/dia449_utt2,6,I'm so-so sorry about yesterday.
train/dia449_utt3,6,I-I'm really sorry.
train/dia449_utt4,1,It's just that I
train/dia449_utt5,0,Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
train/dia449_utt6,2,You do?
train/dia449_utt7,6,Yeah, you still have feelings for me.
train/dia449_utt8,1,And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.
train/dia449_utt9,6,And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't.
train/dia449_utt10,6,It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just  It just wasn't meant to be.
train/dia449_utt11,1,Oh God you're right.
train/dia449_utt12,6,Ross, we we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
train/dia449_utt13,0,No.
train/dia450_utt0,0,I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
train/dia450_utt1,0,Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
train/dia450_utt2,0,Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
train/dia450_utt3,0,Gimme this.
train/dia450_utt4,0,Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
train/dia450_utt5,2,Brides magazines?
train/dia450_utt6,0,Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
train/dia450_utt7,6,Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
train/dia450_utt8,2,It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
train/dia450_utt9,1,I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't.
train/dia450_utt10,1,Right?
train/dia450_utt11,1,I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
train/dia450_utt12,2,Oh my God.
train/dia450_utt13,0,I know.  I need more pie.
train/dia450_utt14,0,Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
train/dia450_utt15,2,You didn't break up with that fireman?
train/dia450_utt16,0,No, that was my way of telling you.
train/dia450_utt17,0,Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
train/dia450_utt18,0,He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
train/dia450_utt19,2,Wow!
train/dia450_utt20,0,Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
train/dia450_utt21,0,So then, are you going to dump Jason?
train/dia450_utt22,0,Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and  Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so's Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
train/dia450_utt23,0,So  It's really just about the math.
train/dia451_utt0,0,Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
train/dia451_utt1,4,Ok, look! Enough is enough!
train/dia451_utt2,1,No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
train/dia451_utt3,0,Monica, that was also true an
train/dia451_utt4,4,I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
train/dia451_utt5,0,You knew this about me when you married me!
train/dia451_utt6,0,You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
train/dia451_utt7,4,Well, this is my sickness!
train/dia452_utt0,0,Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
train/dia452_utt1,0,Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
train/dia452_utt2,0,Yeah me too, all night.
train/dia452_utt3,2,Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
train/dia452_utt4,0,Yeah well that's because uh I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
train/dia453_utt0,2,I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
train/dia453_utt1,2,Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker
train/dia454_utt0,0,Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.
train/dia454_utt1,5,No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
train/dia454_utt2,4,Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
train/dia455_utt0,0,So.
train/dia455_utt1,0,So.
train/dia455_utt2,0,I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
train/dia455_utt3,0,I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
train/dia455_utt4,0,I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
train/dia455_utt5,3,I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
train/dia455_utt6,2,Really? Me?
train/dia455_utt7,2,Oh my god, are you kidding?
train/dia455_utt8,4,Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
train/dia455_utt9,0,Well, you're not totally paranoid.
train/dia455_utt10,1,Oy.
train/dia455_utt11,6,Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
train/dia455_utt12,0,Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
train/dia455_utt13,1,Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
train/dia455_utt14,0,I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
train/dia455_utt15,0,All right, Julie.
train/dia455_utt16,0,Bye.
train/dia455_utt17,5,Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
train/dia456_utt0,1,Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
train/dia456_utt1,0,Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
train/dia456_utt2,4,Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
train/dia456_utt3,2,What?
train/dia456_utt4,6,Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
train/dia456_utt5,2,They put you in jail?
train/dia456_utt6,4,The little jail between the doors!
train/dia456_utt7,4,Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
train/dia456_utt8,4,I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
train/dia456_utt9,6,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
train/dia456_utt10,0,Maybe it was the guy.
train/dia456_utt11,4,It was the ring!
train/dia457_utt0,0,No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
train/dia457_utt1,0,Well, if you want, I'll just I'll just break it off with her.
train/dia457_utt2,4,No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
train/dia457_utt3,0,Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
train/dia457_utt4,0,Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
train/dia457_utt5,2,Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
train/dia457_utt6,1,We can, we can go to Aruba!
train/dia457_utt7,6,When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
train/dia457_utt8,6,You would've liked it.
train/dia457_utt9,0,I had a bra.
train/dia457_utt10,0,Hey, Dr. Farber.
train/dia457_utt11,0,All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.

train/dia459_utt3,4,So were done then!
train/dia459_utt4,0,Almost! But first, we gotta start.
train/dia459_utt5,0,This is a glaucoma test.
train/dia459_utt6,0,Uh-huh.
train/dia459_utt7,0,Sit down.
train/dia459_utt8,0,Okay.
train/dia459_utt9,0,But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
train/dia459_utt10,2,What?!
train/dia459_utt11,4,A small puff of air, now come on!
train/dia460_utt0,3,Sure, now I'm scared.
train/dia460_utt1,0,No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay?  Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
train/dia460_utt2,3,Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
train/dia460_utt3,1,No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
train/dia461_utt0,0,Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
train/dia461_utt1,0,Oh, hey.
train/dia461_utt2,0,Hi.
train/dia461_utt3,0,You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
train/dia462_utt0,2,Hey!
train/dia462_utt1,2,Hey!
train/dia462_utt3,0,No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
train/dia462_utt5,0,Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
train/dia462_utt6,2,You're building a post office?
train/dia462_utt7,0,No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
train/dia462_utt8,2,Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
train/dia462_utt9,0,Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
train/dia462_utt10,0,Power saw kinda got away from me there.
train/dia463_utt0,1,Hi!
train/dia463_utt1,4,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
train/dia463_utt2,0,So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
train/dia463_utt3,6,I can't seem to say goodbye.
train/dia463_utt4,2,Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
train/dia463_utt5,4,Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
train/dia463_utt6,0,It was cheesecake.
train/dia463_utt7,0,It was fine.
train/dia463_utt8,2,It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling   Wow!
train/dia463_utt9,1,My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
train/dia463_utt10,4,Y'know what? Forget it!
train/dia463_utt11,0,Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
train/dia463_utt12,0,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
train/dia463_utt13,0,Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
train/dia464_utt0,0,This one's from me.
train/dia464_utt1,2,Ahh!
train/dia464_utt2,0,It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
train/dia464_utt3,2,A scooter!
train/dia464_utt4,0,Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
train/dia464_utt5,1,No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
train/dia464_utt6,1,Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
train/dia464_utt7,0,Okay.
train/dia464_utt8,0,Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
train/dia464_utt9,0,For my last birthday you gave me a
train/dia464_utt10,0,Okay.
train/dia464_utt11,1,Happy birthday Grandma!
train/dia464_utt12,0,It's better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
train/dia464_utt13,0,All our love Monica and Chandler.
train/dia464_utt14,1,That's funny, yeah!
train/dia464_utt15,2,No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
train/dia464_utt16,1,No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
train/dia464_utt17,6,No, because you're not a grandmother!
train/dia464_utt18,6,No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things.
train/dia464_utt19,0,That's why it's so funny.
train/dia464_utt20,4,All you had to do was buy the card!
train/dia465_utt0,0,Hey, Joey. What's going on?
train/dia465_utt1,0,Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
train/dia465_utt2,5,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
train/dia465_utt3,6,Sorry. Wrong boobies.
train/dia465_utt4,0,Hello, Joey.
train/dia465_utt5,2,Oh! ...Hello, dear.
train/dia466_utt0,2,Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
train/dia466_utt1,1,I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
train/dia466_utt2,2,Really?
train/dia466_utt3,5,No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
train/dia466_utt4,0,Hey, buddy.
train/dia466_utt5,0,Oh, that's attractive.
train/dia466_utt6,1,Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
train/dia466_utt7,5,Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
train/dia466_utt8,0,Oh, ah- the kid has it.
train/dia466_utt9,4,The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
train/dia466_utt10,0,You gotta do it, man.
train/dia466_utt11,4,Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever  can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
train/dia466_utt12,4,Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
train/dia466_utt13,4,Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!

train/dia467_utt0,1,Oh, look, wish me luck!
train/dia467_utt1,0,What for?
train/dia467_utt2,0,I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
train/dia468_utt0,0,Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?
train/dia468_utt1,4,You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
train/dia468_utt2,2,What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
train/dia468_utt3,1,Hi!
train/dia468_utt4,1,I'm so glad you could make it.
train/dia468_utt5,1,Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
train/dia468_utt6,1,Try. There's my little girl.
train/dia468_utt7,0,She's still mad.
train/dia468_utt8,1,Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
train/dia468_utt9,2,Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
train/dia469_utt0,0,Oh, that's very Really very-very okay.
train/dia469_utt1,1,Julie's cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that's about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
train/dia470_utt0,0,Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?
train/dia471_utt0,5,No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
train/dia471_utt1,5,We're not gonna do that.
train/dia471_utt2,0,Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.
train/dia471_utt3,0,Am I interrupting?
train/dia471_utt4,1,Uh yes! Thank you.
train/dia471_utt5,0,Oh. Oh wait no.
train/dia471_utt6,0,Later.
train/dia472_utt1,0,Oh uh, I'm sorry.
train/dia472_utt2,3,No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
train/dia473_utt0,0,Try feeding her again.
train/dia473_utt1,0,I already fed her.
train/dia473_utt2,4,I know, that's why I said again!
train/dia473_utt3,3,Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay?   That's just what she wants.
train/dia473_utt4,0,Hey.
train/dia474_utt0,1,Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
train/dia474_utt1,6,Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
train/dia474_utt2,1,For what?
train/dia474_utt3,6,Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
train/dia474_utt4,0,And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
train/dia474_utt5,2,You al-you already had it?
train/dia474_utt6,0,Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
train/dia474_utt7,6,Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
train/dia474_utt8,6,We ruined everything.
train/dia474_utt9,6,Ugh
train/dia474_utt10,6,Well no, wait a minute, that's not true!
train/dia474_utt11,1,No, what did, that was really sweet.
train/dia474_utt12,1,And it kinda works out for the best.
train/dia474_utt13,2,What do you, what do you mean?
train/dia474_utt14,1,Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
train/dia474_utt15,1,I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don't even like!
train/dia474_utt16,6,Surprise
train/dia474_utt17,1,Surprise
train/dia474_utt18,0,Monica.
train/dia475_utt0,4,I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
train/dia475_utt1,0,Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
train/dia475_utt2,0,Not you guys.
train/dia475_utt3,1,You got it going on!
train/dia475_utt4,0,So, what are we gonna do today?
train/dia475_utt5,0,They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
train/dia475_utt6,2,Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
train/dia475_utt7,1,I don't think so!
train/dia475_utt8,0,Why not?
train/dia475_utt9,0,Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
train/dia475_utt10,0,I'm not always that bad!
train/dia475_utt11,0,Oh,
train/dia475_utt12,2,I punched you...?
train/dia475_utt13,2,And...?
train/dia475_utt14,2,... Phoebe...?
train/dia475_utt15,0,... and...?
train/dia475_utt16,0,I clunked your heads together!
train/dia476_utt0,6,Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
train/dia476_utt1,0,Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
train/dia476_utt2,0,Yeah.
train/dia476_utt3,2,Hey!
train/dia476_utt4,6,I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
train/dia476_utt5,2,What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
train/dia476_utt6,0,Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
train/dia476_utt7,3,All right. Did everyone get out okay?
train/dia476_utt8,0,Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
train/dia476_utt9,2,Ohh. What is this?
train/dia476_utt10,3,No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
train/dia476_utt11,6,Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
train/dia477_utt0,0,Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
train/dia477_utt1,0,Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
train/dia477_utt2,0,Hot dog?
train/dia477_utt3,3,Four, please.  I'm really nervous.  Thank you.
train/dia477_utt4,0,So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
train/dia477_utt5,1,I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
train/dia477_utt6,6,Ohh, that's too bad!
train/dia477_utt7,1,No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
train/dia477_utt8,0,Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
train/dia477_utt9,1,Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
train/dia477_utt10,5,Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
train/dia477_utt11,0,Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?

train/dia477_utt16,0,Okay, I had to put on lotion!
train/dia477_utt17,0,But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
train/dia477_utt18,0,Fight's over!
train/dia478_utt0,0,Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
train/dia478_utt1,2,Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
train/dia478_utt2,1,Hi guys!
train/dia478_utt3,0,Hey!
train/dia478_utt4,0,What are you up too?
train/dia478_utt5,0,Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites.
train/dia478_utt6,0,Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
train/dia478_utt7,0,Yeah, Big Brother.
train/dia478_utt8,0,Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
train/dia478_utt9,0,Yeah, well  Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
train/dia478_utt10,4,Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
train/dia478_utt11,0,Eh
train/dia478_utt12,6,Okay well that's good to know.
train/dia478_utt13,1,The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
train/dia479_utt0,1,Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
train/dia479_utt1,0,Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
train/dia479_utt2,0,My friend's name is Joey.
train/dia479_utt3,0,Apparently Howie's editing now.
train/dia479_utt4,4,Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
train/dia479_utt5,2,Can you believe that?!
train/dia479_utt6,2,Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
train/dia479_utt7,5,Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
train/dia479_utt8,5,No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!

train/dia481_utt10,0,Which one?
train/dia481_utt11,0,I don't know, what were the names I just said?

train/dia482_utt2,4,We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
train/dia482_utt3,0,That's not mine.
train/dia482_utt4,0,Yes it is.
train/dia482_utt5,3,How do you know?
train/dia482_utt6,5,The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
train/dia482_utt7,4,Okay do you Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
train/dia482_utt8,0,Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
train/dia482_utt9,4,Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!
train/dia482_utt10,0,There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
train/dia482_utt11,2,There's a reset button?!
train/dia482_utt12,2,My God!
train/dia482_utt13,2,Why didn't I see that!
train/dia482_utt14,0,Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
train/dia482_utt15,1,Oh here it is!

train/dia483_utt6,4,I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
train/dia483_utt7,0,Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
train/dia483_utt8,4,Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
train/dia483_utt9,4,Nngghhh!!!!!!!
train/dia483_utt10,0,Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
train/dia483_utt11,0,"Heating device."
train/dia483_utt12,0,Radiator.

train/dia484_utt1,0,Well, how long do you think it'll be?
train/dia484_utt2,0,Any minute now.
train/dia485_utt0,1,Hey, this-  Heyy...
train/dia486_utt0,0,Hey.
train/dia486_utt1,0,Hey! Any good mail?
train/dia486_utt2,0,Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
train/dia486_utt3,0,Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda .
train/dia486_utt4,0,"Benefits lapsed."
train/dia486_utt5,0,Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
train/dia486_utt6,0,Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
train/dia486_utt7,2,Let me see that!
train/dia486_utt8,0,All right.
train/dia486_utt9,2,Oh, I can't believe this!
train/dia486_utt10,4,This sucks!
train/dia486_utt11,3,When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know?
train/dia486_utt12,4,And it wouldn't matter.
train/dia486_utt13,4,Now I gotta be careful?
train/dia486_utt14,6,I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
train/dia486_utt15,6,All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
train/dia486_utt16,0,Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
train/dia486_utt17,1,look both ways before you cross the street.
train/dia487_utt0,2,I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
train/dia488_utt0,1,I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
train/dia488_utt1,0,I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
train/dia488_utt2,0,Do you know anything about women?
train/dia488_utt3,0,No.
train/dia488_utt4,0,That's all right.
train/dia488_utt5,0,Okay.
train/dia489_utt0,1,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
train/dia489_utt1,1,Yeah. He could row like a viking.
train/dia489_utt2,0,Hi.
train/dia489_utt3,0,Mmm.
train/dia489_utt4,0,So how'd it go?
train/dia490_utt0,0,Oh, y'know..
train/dia491_utt0,0,Did he mention us?
train/dia491_utt1,6,He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
train/dia491_utt2,6,You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
train/dia492_utt0,1,...love you.
train/dia492_utt1,0,Are you're hands still wet?
train/dia492_utt2,0,Uh, moist, yeah.
train/dia492_utt3,0,Let's dry 'em again.
train/dia493_utt0,6,Oh my God! Oh my God!!
train/dia493_utt1,2,Still crying?
train/dia493_utt2,0,Like a
train/dia493_utt3,0,Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
train/dia493_utt4,0,What's the other one?
train/dia493_utt5,0,I don't know, I've never had to use the other one.
train/dia493_utt6,0,I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
train/dia493_utt7,1,Oh that's right.
train/dia493_utt8,0,You're the talker.
train/dia493_utt9,1,Anyway uh, great idea!
train/dia493_utt10,0,Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
train/dia493_utt11,0,Oh, we have some
train/dia493_utt12,4,No you don't!
train/dia494_utt0,0,Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
train/dia495_utt0,0,Yeah, what town are we near?
train/dia495_utt1,0,Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
train/dia495_utt2,4,Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
train/dia496_utt0,0,Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
train/dia496_utt1,0,Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?
train/dia496_utt2,6,I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
train/dia496_utt3,0,Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
train/dia496_utt4,0,Okay!
train/dia496_utt5,0,Yeah, no they don't do that.
train/dia496_utt6,0,Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
train/dia496_utt7,4,Who?
train/dia496_utt8,3,I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
train/dia496_utt9,0,I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
train/dia496_utt10,4,No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
train/dia496_utt11,3,But if...
train/dia496_utt12,4,No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
train/dia496_utt13,1,Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
train/dia496_utt14,0,So the going for help went well?
train/dia497_utt0,0,I'm telling you man, I saw it.
train/dia497_utt1,4,Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
train/dia497_utt2,6,I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
train/dia498_utt0,0,I know.
train/dia498_utt1,0,Let's try a look of far off wonderment.
train/dia498_utt2,1,Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come.
train/dia498_utt3,2,Chandler!
train/dia498_utt4,2,What is the matter with your face?!
train/dia498_utt5,4,I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"
train/dia498_utt6,4,Hey!
train/dia498_utt7,4,Don't laugh at him!
train/dia498_utt8,0,He's
train/dia499_utt0,1,We're gonna find love!
train/dia499_utt1,1,Definitely!
train/dia499_utt2,0,Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.
train/dia499_utt3,1,That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
train/dia499_utt4,0,It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
train/dia499_utt5,0,What do you mean?
train/dia499_utt6,0,Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
train/dia499_utt7,0,You mean a backup?
train/dia499_utt8,1,Exactly!
train/dia499_utt9,0,Yeah, yeah I got that.
train/dia499_utt10,0,You do?
train/dia499_utt11,0,Hm-mmm
train/dia499_utt12,0,Who?

train/dia499_utt18,2,Wh  So  If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
train/dia499_utt19,0,Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
train/dia499_utt20,2,Oh, seriously?
train/dia499_utt21,0,Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
train/dia500_utt0,0,Yeah, I'm sorry man.  You wanna go watch?

train/dia501_utt7,0,Oh.

train/dia503_utt3,1,Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
train/dia503_utt4,1,I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
train/dia503_utt5,1,Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
train/dia503_utt6,0,What do you say?

train/dia504_utt13,4,Cut me a real piece!
train/dia505_utt0,2,Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
train/dia505_utt1,0,I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.

train/dia505_utt7,0,Well, umm, not much.

train/dia505_utt9,0,So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
train/dia505_utt10,0,Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
train/dia505_utt11,0,Nothing..Why?

train/dia505_utt13,0,Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
train/dia505_utt14,4,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
train/dia505_utt15,0,Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
train/dia506_utt0,6,Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this.
train/dia506_utt1,3,Okay,  I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you.

train/dia506_utt4,0,No.
train/dia506_utt5,6,I can't, you're a totally different person to me now.

train/dia506_utt7,6,God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't,  it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.

train/dia509_utt5,0,Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are.

train/dia509_utt15,0,Would you like to see a semi-private room?
train/dia509_utt16,0,Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
train/dia510_utt0,0,I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
train/dia510_utt1,1,That's funny. Who are they?
train/dia510_utt2,0,The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
train/dia510_utt3,2,You mean they're lovers.
train/dia510_utt4,0,If you wanna put a label on it.
train/dia510_utt5,2,Wow, uh, anything else I should know?

train/dia512_utt7,1,Yeah!
train/dia512_utt8,4,And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!

train/dia520_utt6,0,It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
train/dia521_utt0,0,There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
train/dia521_utt1,0,I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
train/dia521_utt2,6,And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.
train/dia521_utt3,4,Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
train/dia521_utt4,6,And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.

train/dia524_utt10,0,Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
train/dia524_utt11,4,You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
train/dia524_utt12,0,Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
train/dia524_utt13,6,So, what happens to the old guys?
train/dia524_utt14,0,Well, they go into the chipper.
train/dia524_utt15,3,Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!

train/dia525_utt5,0,So, whaddya think George is like?
train/dia525_utt6,0,I think he's shy.
train/dia525_utt7,2,Yeah?
train/dia525_utt8,0,Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
train/dia526_utt0,1,Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean,
train/dia526_utt1,0,Aren't you with that girl over there?
train/dia526_utt2,0,Well, yeah, kinda.
train/dia526_utt3,0,Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you.
train/dia526_utt4,1,No, no, no, it's flattery.
train/dia526_utt5,1,Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
train/dia526_utt6,3,Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast.
train/dia526_utt7,0,I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
train/dia526_utt8,0,Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
train/dia526_utt9,0,Um, yeah.
train/dia526_utt10,0,May I see it?
train/dia526_utt11,3,Um, no.
train/dia526_utt12,1,Come on!
train/dia526_utt13,0,But, okay.
train/dia526_utt14,2,I'm not on the list!
train/dia526_utt15,0,Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
train/dia526_utt16,4,It's laminated!
train/dia526_utt17,0,Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
train/dia526_utt18,0,Y'know it's ironic...
train/dia526_utt19,0,...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
train/dia526_utt20,0,We're just gonna be friends.
train/dia527_utt0,4,Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
train/dia527_utt1,1,Hey Pheebs!
train/dia527_utt2,2,Ohh! You made up!

train/dia527_utt4,1,Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
train/dia527_utt5,5,Ohh, get a room.
train/dia527_utt6,0,We have one.
train/dia527_utt7,5,I know. Use it.
train/dia528_utt0,2,Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!
train/dia528_utt1,0,Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
train/dia528_utt2,0,Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
train/dia528_utt3,2,Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
train/dia528_utt4,0,Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
train/dia528_utt5,4,Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
train/dia529_utt0,4,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
train/dia529_utt1,0,So that's the only reason she could be here huh?
train/dia529_utt2,0,It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a
train/dia529_utt3,4,Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
train/dia529_utt4,0,I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.
train/dia529_utt5,0,Good-bye.
train/dia529_utt6,2,Whoa!
train/dia529_utt7,0,Uh, that was your sister actually.
train/dia529_utt8,0,She-she thinks that you're just using me.
train/dia529_utt9,0,So?
train/dia530_utt0,6,I'm sorry.
train/dia530_utt1,2,What are you doing here?!
train/dia530_utt2,0,I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
train/dia530_utt3,2,What?!
train/dia530_utt4,0,Umm, okay, okay, look.
train/dia530_utt5,4,I took this picture from your fridge.
train/dia530_utt6,4,Okay, because I know that this is my Father.
train/dia530_utt7,4,Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.
train/dia530_utt8,4,Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.
train/dia530_utt9,4,All right?
train/dia530_utt10,4,So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
train/dia530_utt11,4,Otherwise, you're just mean!
train/dia530_utt12,4,So, just tell me the truth!
train/dia530_utt13,0,All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
train/dia530_utt14,2,My Father is Chuck Magioni?
train/dia530_utt15,0,No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
train/dia530_utt16,6,And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
train/dia530_utt17,6,Oh.
train/dia530_utt18,0,But umm, you're right.
train/dia530_utt19,0,I think that a person should know where they come from.
train/dia530_utt20,0,Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.
train/dia530_utt21,0,I'm your mother.
train/dia530_utt22,2,Heh?
train/dia530_utt23,6,Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
train/dia531_utt0,2,What's happening to your accent?
train/dia531_utt1,2,Come again?
train/dia531_utt2,3,What's-what's this nonsense?
train/dia531_utt3,6,All right, I'm-I'm not English.
train/dia531_utt4,0,I'm from Long Island.
train/dia531_utt5,6,I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
train/dia531_utt6,6,I'm sorry.
train/dia531_utt7,0,So, if we could just get back to the lecture.
train/dia531_utt8,0,Umm, were there any questions?
train/dia531_utt9,0,About paleontology.
train/dia531_utt10,4,All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.
train/dia531_utt11,6,Obviously, I screwed up.
train/dia531_utt12,0,But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.
train/dia531_utt13,0,So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
train/dia531_utt14,4,Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
train/dia531_utt15,2,Well, hello Rachel!
train/dia532_utt0,0,Where you going, Joe?
train/dia532_utt1,0,For a walk.
train/dia532_utt2,0,Oh. You mind if I join you?
train/dia532_utt3,0,Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
train/dia532_utt4,2,Your thoughts? Plural?
train/dia532_utt5,1,Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!
train/dia532_utt6,0,I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
train/dia532_utt7,4,Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
train/dia532_utt8,6,You guys are killing me!
train/dia532_utt9,6,She's forbidden fruit!
train/dia532_utt10,6,It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?
train/dia532_utt11,0,Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
train/dia532_utt12,0,Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
train/dia532_utt13,4,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
train/dia532_utt14,2,Great novels?
train/dia532_utt15,0,Fine ... mediocre porn
train/dia533_utt0,0,Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.
train/dia533_utt1,0,Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
train/dia533_utt2,6,That's kinda sad.
train/dia533_utt3,0,Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,
train/dia533_utt4,1,Got it!
train/dia533_utt5,1,Let's roll!
train/dia533_utt6,0,Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
train/dia533_utt7,0,Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.
train/dia533_utt8,0,Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
train/dia533_utt9,0,Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
train/dia534_utt0,0,Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
train/dia534_utt1,0,Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
train/dia534_utt2,1,Oh! No problem! I
train/dia534_utt3,2,What?
train/dia535_utt0,0,You are iron.
train/dia535_utt1,1,You are steel!
train/dia535_utt2,4,Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
train/dia535_utt3,0,I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
train/dia536_utt0,2,I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
train/dia536_utt1,0,Look, you and I went to different high schools...
train/dia536_utt2,0,Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
train/dia536_utt3,0,You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
train/dia536_utt4,6,I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
train/dia536_utt5,2,They had to have that specially made?!
train/dia536_utt6,0,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
train/dia536_utt7,2,Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
train/dia536_utt8,2,Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out.
train/dia536_utt9,1,And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
train/dia536_utt10,0,I-I owe her this.
train/dia536_utt11,0,I never let her eat.
train/dia536_utt12,0,Oh, you go out with him.
train/dia536_utt13,2,Oh, really?!
train/dia536_utt14,0,Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
train/dia536_utt15,0,I'll try.
train/dia537_utt0,0,Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
train/dia537_utt1,0,Yeah, yeah, okay.
train/dia537_utt2,1,Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown   I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
train/dia537_utt3,4,Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
train/dia537_utt4,0,Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
train/dia538_utt0,4,Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
train/dia538_utt1,6,Yeah but
train/dia538_utt2,0,Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
train/dia538_utt3,4,Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
train/dia538_utt4,1,Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
train/dia538_utt5,1,Okay. Hey Ooh, cool sheets!
train/dia538_utt6,1,Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?

train/dia558_utt3,2,Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
train/dia558_utt4,3,Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
train/dia558_utt5,0,Ummmmmmmm, no.
train/dia558_utt6,4,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
train/dia558_utt8,6,Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
train/dia559_utt0,0,Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
train/dia559_utt1,0,Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

train/dia561_utt0,0,Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
train/dia561_utt1,1,So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
train/dia561_utt2,0,Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
train/dia561_utt3,2,Oh my god.
train/dia561_utt4,2,What?

train/dia561_utt10,0,Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
train/dia561_utt11,5,Oh my god, what were you thinking?
train/dia561_utt12,0,All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
train/dia561_utt13,2,Oh!

train/dia574_utt10,0,It happened in London.
train/dia574_utt11,2,IN LONDON!!!
train/dia574_utt12,0,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
train/dia574_utt13,2,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
train/dia574_utt14,3,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!

train/dia575_utt0,0,And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
train/dia575_utt1,0,Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
train/dia575_utt2,0,No Cobb, as in cobb salad.

train/dia576_utt0,3,What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
train/dia576_utt1,0,Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
train/dia576_utt2,2,Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
train/dia576_utt3,0,You got a better idea?
train/dia576_utt4,0,All right, call it in the air.
train/dia576_utt5,0,Heads.
train/dia576_utt6,0,Heads it is.
train/dia576_utt7,1,Yes! Whew!
train/dia576_utt8,0,We have to assign heads to something.
train/dia576_utt9,0,Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
train/dia576_utt10,4,What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
train/dia577_utt0,0,Okay, some tricks of the trade.
train/dia577_utt1,0,Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.
train/dia577_utt2,0,Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil.
train/dia577_utt3,0,That would be the basic  I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it'  Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
train/dia577_utt4,0,And that's how it's done.
train/dia577_utt5,1,Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
train/dia577_utt6,0,Hey, Mr. Trib.

train/dia578_utt3,2,I'm Chandler's new roommate.
train/dia578_utt4,2,I-I-I don't think so.
train/dia578_utt5,2,I could be Chandler's new roommate.
train/dia578_utt6,2,But, he told me over the phone.
train/dia578_utt7,0,He told me in person.
train/dia578_utt8,2,That's weird.
train/dia578_utt9,1,Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!

train/dia579_utt1,1,Oh, hey guys!
train/dia580_utt0,0,Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
train/dia580_utt1,0,Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
train/dia581_utt0,0,Or we could just follow your clever jokes   any ideas?
train/dia582_utt0,0,Didn't think so!
train/dia583_utt0,0,Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
train/dia583_utt1,4,Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?

train/dia584_utt5,0,I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
train/dia584_utt6,2,Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
train/dia584_utt7,1,This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
train/dia584_utt8,2,Mom no, come on! Thank you.
train/dia584_utt9,3,Just hear me out!
train/dia585_utt0,6,Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus.
train/dia585_utt1,6,I can't believe this!
train/dia585_utt2,6,I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross.

train/dia589_utt6,0,Did you hear that?!
train/dia589_utt7,4,I don't need you guys to care about me!
train/dia589_utt8,1,Because the universe cares!
train/dia589_utt9,1,The whole universe!
train/dia589_utt10,6,I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
train/dia590_utt0,1,I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
train/dia590_utt1,1,They can't all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
train/dia590_utt2,2,Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?

train/dia593_utt6,6,Is it something I'm putting out there?
train/dia593_utt7,6,Is this my fault?
train/dia593_utt8,6,Or am I just nuts?
train/dia593_utt9,2,I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.

train/dia595_utt4,6,Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
train/dia595_utt5,4,Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.
train/dia595_utt6,3,This doesn't mean anything, does it?
train/dia596_utt0,4,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
train/dia596_utt1,0,That is true.
train/dia596_utt2,0,Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
train/dia596_utt3,0,Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
train/dia596_utt4,0,Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
train/dia596_utt5,6,Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
train/dia596_utt6,4,Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.

train/dia596_utt10,4,But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
train/dia596_utt11,3,He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
train/dia596_utt12,0,But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
train/dia596_utt13,0,I think that's gum.
train/dia596_utt14,0,I'm pretty sure it's gun.
train/dia596_utt15,4,Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
train/dia596_utt16,4,A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?
train/dia596_utt17,0,That was the only way I could get him to
train/dia596_utt18,0,Hi! How are the Gellers?
train/dia596_utt19,4,Don't call us that!
train/dia596_utt20,4,The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?

train/dia597_utt4,0,Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know?
train/dia597_utt5,0,Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
train/dia597_utt6,1,Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
train/dia597_utt7,0,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
train/dia597_utt8,1,Stop it!
train/dia597_utt9,0,No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
train/dia597_utt10,0,I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
train/dia597_utt11,0,Yeah?
train/dia598_utt0,1,Of course he is!
train/dia598_utt1,1,What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse?
train/dia598_utt2,4,What kind of father do you think I am?
train/dia598_utt3,0,All right, sorry.
train/dia598_utt4,0,I gotta go make a fake Ben.
train/dia599_utt0,2,The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
train/dia599_utt1,0,Well, either that or uh
train/dia599_utt2,4,Joey!!
train/dia599_utt3,0,Yeah?
train/dia599_utt4,4,Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
train/dia599_utt5,4,Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
train/dia599_utt6,1,Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
train/dia599_utt7,1,They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
train/dia599_utt8,0,Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
train/dia599_utt9,1,Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
train/dia599_utt10,4,Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a
train/dia599_utt11,0,Sure!

train/dia602_utt0,1,I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
train/dia602_utt1,1,Yeah, isn't he?
train/dia602_utt2,1,It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
train/dia602_utt3,1,You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
train/dia602_utt4,2,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
train/dia602_utt5,0,Huh. That's nice.
train/dia603_utt0,0,and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for
train/dia603_utt1,0,Eight whole days.
train/dia603_utt2,1,That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.

train/dia604_utt4,2,I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
train/dia604_utt5,0,Why would you say that?
train/dia604_utt6,0, Cause you're still into Monica.
train/dia604_utt7,0,So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so  cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
train/dia604_utt8,1,You're good. You're good!
train/dia604_utt9,0,Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
train/dia604_utt10,3,Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
train/dia604_utt11,0,Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
train/dia604_utt12,0,Thanks a lot.

train/dia607_utt9,0,Well, yeah, I have one now and then.
train/dia607_utt10,0,Well, yeah, now.
train/dia607_utt11,0,Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.
train/dia607_utt12,1,Well, okay, thanks!
train/dia607_utt13,1,God, he's good.
train/dia607_utt14,0,If only he were a woman.
train/dia607_utt15,0,Yeah.
train/dia608_utt0,2,Oh, look look look.
train/dia608_utt1,0,The last candle's about to burn out.
train/dia608_utt2,0,10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
train/dia608_utt3,0,Thank you.
train/dia608_utt4,0,Thanks.
train/dia608_utt5,3,Kinda... spooky without any lights.
train/dia608_utt6,1,Bwah-hah-hah!
train/dia608_utt7,1,OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
train/dia608_utt8,0,Oh.. oh... oh.
train/dia608_utt9,0,Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
train/dia609_utt0,0,All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
train/dia610_utt0,1,You blew them away!
train/dia610_utt1,1,Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
train/dia610_utt2,0,I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
train/dia610_utt3,2,I was
train/dia610_utt4,1,No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
train/dia610_utt5,2,Oh my God!  I'm your
train/dia610_utt6,1,I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
train/dia610_utt7,1,Look, I took it too far!
train/dia611_utt0,0,Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
train/dia611_utt1,0,Could've played
train/dia611_utt2,0,Thanks.
train/dia611_utt3,0,Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
train/dia611_utt4,0,Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the
train/dia611_utt5,0,Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
train/dia611_utt6,0,Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.
train/dia611_utt7,2,Nooo!
train/dia611_utt8,0,Hello?
train/dia611_utt9,0,Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.
train/dia611_utt10,1,Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
train/dia611_utt11,0,Green. To the green.
train/dia611_utt12,0,I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
train/dia611_utt13,0,To the left, to the left- aww!
train/dia611_utt14,0,Ohhh... I'm fine.
train/dia612_utt0,1,Hey!
train/dia612_utt1,3,Please tell me you got the message!
train/dia612_utt2,0,What message?
train/dia612_utt3,0,The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
train/dia612_utt4,2,What?! It's 6 o'clock!
train/dia612_utt5,3,Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
train/dia612_utt6,4,I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!
train/dia612_utt7,0,I went to Ross's!
train/dia612_utt8,0,I went to the coffeehouse!
train/dia612_utt9,0,I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
train/dia613_utt0,0,That's the day you're gonna die? See darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
train/dia613_utt1,0,That's what you think.
train/dia613_utt2,0,Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
train/dia613_utt3,0,Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
train/dia613_utt4,0,What was her name?
train/dia613_utt5,0,Nestley Toulouse.
train/dia613_utt6,0,Nestlé Toll House?
train/dia613_utt7,0,Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
train/dia613_utt8,2,Yes!!  Oh.
train/dia613_utt9,4,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
train/dia613_utt10,4,I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you're burning in hell!!
train/dia614_utt0,0,So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
train/dia614_utt1,1,Absolutely!
train/dia614_utt2,1,I am so on board!
train/dia614_utt3,0,Rachel didn't you just light that?
train/dia614_utt4,0,Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
train/dia614_utt5,0,I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
train/dia614_utt6,5,Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
train/dia614_utt7,0,Tell me about it!
train/dia614_utt8,1,Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
train/dia614_utt9,0,It does sound appealing.
train/dia614_utt10,1,Oh, I never could do it.
train/dia614_utt11,0,Oh but you could.
train/dia614_utt12,0,You can.
train/dia614_utt13,1,Absolutely!
train/dia614_utt14,1,We can help each other out!
train/dia614_utt15,0,We can get--what are those--those patches!
train/dia614_utt16,1,We could be like the Patch Sisters!
train/dia614_utt17,1,Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
train/dia614_utt18,1,Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
train/dia614_utt19,6,My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
train/dia614_utt20,1,Okay then!
train/dia615_utt0,0,Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
train/dia615_utt1,0,Does, um, anyone wanna see?
train/dia615_utt2,5,Nooo..
train/dia615_utt3,4,Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
train/dia615_utt4,5,It's worse than the thumb!
train/dia615_utt5,4,Hey, this is so unfair!
train/dia615_utt6,2,Oh, why is it unfair?
train/dia615_utt7,4,So I have a flaw!
train/dia615_utt8,4,Big deal!
train/dia615_utt9,4,Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
train/dia615_utt10,4,And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
train/dia615_utt11,4,And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
train/dia615_utt12,5,I mean, what the hell is that thing?
train/dia615_utt13,4,...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
train/dia615_utt14,4,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
train/dia615_utt15,0,Well, I-I could live without it.
train/dia615_utt16,0,Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
train/dia615_utt17,0,Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
train/dia615_utt18,4,Oh,  "you do, do you"?
train/dia615_utt19,0,You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
train/dia615_utt20,1,"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
train/dia615_utt21,0,Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
train/dia615_utt22,4,Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
train/dia616_utt0,6,Awww! Mel Torme died.
train/dia616_utt1,0,Joey, that paper's like a year old!
train/dia616_utt2,6,Aw! Does that mean the
train/dia616_utt3,0,Hey.
train/dia616_utt4,0,Hey.
train/dia617_utt0,0,You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
train/dia617_utt1,0,Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
train/dia617_utt2,0,Probably?
train/dia617_utt3,5,Yeah, I don't like that word.
train/dia617_utt4,0,Kind of what  probably' really means.
train/dia617_utt5,0,Yeah, uh-huh.
train/dia617_utt6,4,Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know?
train/dia617_utt7,4,I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
train/dia617_utt8,0,You gotta take care of yourselves!
train/dia617_utt9,0,In
train/dia617_utt10,0,Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
train/dia618_utt0,1,Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
train/dia618_utt1,1,Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
train/dia619_utt0,0,He's a keeper. How are you feeling?
train/dia619_utt1,0,Oh, I'm fine.
train/dia619_utt2,0,Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.
train/dia619_utt3,0,Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
train/dia619_utt4,0,Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
train/dia619_utt5,0,Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
train/dia619_utt6,0,I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.
train/dia619_utt7,6,Well I That's never gonna happen with Ross.
train/dia619_utt8,5,Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
train/dia620_utt0,0,And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
train/dia621_utt0,0,Hey. Who's that?
train/dia621_utt1,0,New people.
train/dia621_utt2,0,What happened to the Disgustingtons?
train/dia621_utt3,4,They're having their baby!
train/dia621_utt4,4,It's not fair Ross we got here first!
train/dia621_utt5,0,Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
train/dia621_utt6,0,Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
train/dia621_utt7,2,Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
train/dia622_utt0,0,Phoebe?
train/dia622_utt1,0,Yeah?
train/dia622_utt2,2,Look at that guy by the window, wow!
train/dia622_utt3,0,He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
train/dia622_utt4,6,Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
train/dia622_utt5,0,I mean it's like every guy I see I mean look here.
train/dia622_utt6,0,Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
train/dia622_utt7,0,Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
train/dia622_utt8,0,Yeah.
train/dia622_utt9,0,This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
train/dia622_utt10,2,Really?! So this has happened to you?
train/dia622_utt11,0,Oh absolutely yeah!
train/dia622_utt12,0,Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
train/dia622_utt13,1,Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.
train/dia622_utt14,0,Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
train/dia623_utt0,5,Ugh!
train/dia623_utt1,3,I don't know what I'm going to do!
train/dia623_utt2,4,I called the company that sent and th-they don't care!
train/dia623_utt3,4,Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
train/dia623_utt4,1,Hey guys!
train/dia623_utt5,1,Hey!
train/dia623_utt6,0,Hey
train/dia623_utt7,1,I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
train/dia623_utt8,1,And the guys from work had a blast.
train/dia623_utt9,1,Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
train/dia623_utt10,1,Yeah!
train/dia623_utt11,2,And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
train/dia623_utt12,1,So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
train/dia623_utt13,1,Yeah, right!
train/dia623_utt14,0,I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
train/dia623_utt15,2,That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
train/dia623_utt16,2,So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
train/dia623_utt17,1,Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
train/dia623_utt18,1,So you might say, it's a magic ring.
train/dia624_utt0,2,OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
train/dia625_utt0,0,Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
train/dia625_utt1,0,Obviously! So, how do we decide?
train/dia625_utt2,0,Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her
train/dia625_utt3,0,Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
train/dia625_utt4,1,That's interesting, but check this out. I date her
train/dia625_utt5,0,Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
train/dia625_utt6,0,Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
train/dia625_utt7,0,Yeah well we should order some food then.
train/dia625_utt8,0,No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll
train/dia625_utt9,0,That sounds fair.
train/dia625_utt10,0,Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
train/dia625_utt11,4,Ah yeah wait a second now!
train/dia625_utt12,0,Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
train/dia625_utt13,4,I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
train/dia625_utt14,0,Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
train/dia625_utt15,0,All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
train/dia625_utt16,0,So let's decide on the spending limit
train/dia625_utt17,0,Yeah. Uh,  a slice  six dollars?
train/dia625_utt18,0,I was thinking more like a hundred.
train/dia625_utt19,0,Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
train/dia626_utt0,0,Hi, again.
train/dia626_utt1,0,Hey!
train/dia626_utt2,0,Hey!
train/dia626_utt3,1,Thank you soo, much.
train/dia626_utt4,4,Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
train/dia626_utt5,0,You want some help with that?
train/dia626_utt6,0,Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don't!
train/dia626_utt7,2,Whoa! Are you okay?
train/dia626_utt8,2,Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
train/dia626_utt9,0,It's the heat.  And-and the humidity.
train/dia626_utt10,0,That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
train/dia626_utt11,0,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
train/dia626_utt12,2,Like you wouldn't believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
train/dia626_utt13,0,What do you mean?
train/dia627_utt0,0,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
train/dia628_utt0,2,Oh!
train/dia628_utt1,0,Hey, somebody left their keys.
train/dia628_utt2,2,Ooohh, to a Porsche!
train/dia628_utt3,0,Hey Gunther, these yours?
train/dia628_utt4,5,Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
train/dia628_utt5,0,Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
train/dia628_utt6,0,Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
train/dia628_utt7,2,There's a lost and found?  My shoe!
train/dia628_utt8,2,You left a shoe here?!
train/dia628_utt9,0,Well, I didn't realize until I got home.
train/dia628_utt10,0,I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
train/dia628_utt11,0,I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
train/dia628_utt12,0,Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
train/dia628_utt13,1,Great! Thanks.
train/dia629_utt0,0,Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
train/dia629_utt1,1,Carol, we've been through this before, ok?
train/dia629_utt2,1,We have a good time.
train/dia629_utt3,1,We laugh, we play.
train/dia629_utt4,1,It's like we're father and son.
train/dia629_utt5,1,Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
train/dia629_utt6,1,Oh, this is so cute.
train/dia629_utt7,0,Oh, I got that for him.
train/dia629_utt8,1,My mommies love me. That's clever.
train/dia629_utt9,0,Hello?
train/dia629_utt10,0,Oh, Hi, Ju  Hi, Jew!
train/dia629_utt11,0,Uh huh?
train/dia629_utt12,0,Uh huh?
train/dia629_utt13,0,Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.
train/dia629_utt14,0,See ya then.
train/dia629_utt15,0,Bye.
train/dia629_utt16,2,Did you just say Hi, Jew?
train/dia629_utt17,0,Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
train/dia630_utt0,1,Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
train/dia630_utt1,1,Thanks Monica!
train/dia630_utt2,5,Does that smell bother you?
train/dia630_utt3,2,What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
train/dia630_utt4,0,Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
train/dia630_utt5,1,I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
train/dia630_utt6,1,Okay!
train/dia630_utt7,0,Okay.
train/dia630_utt8,0,Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
train/dia630_utt9,2,Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
train/dia630_utt10,0,Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire.
train/dia630_utt11,0,No-no, it was the candles.
train/dia630_utt12,0,It's very not good leaving candles unattended.
train/dia630_utt13,0,In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is   Uhh  Uhh  Okay.
train/dia630_utt14,0,Well, I have to go now.
train/dia631_utt0,2,Joey proposed to me.
train/dia632_utt0,2,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
train/dia632_utt1,3,Well, I-I said yes.
train/dia632_utt2,2,What?!
train/dia632_utt3,4,Are you crazy?
train/dia632_utt4,4,You just had Ross's baby!
train/dia632_utt5,4,It's-it's so  inappropriate.
train/dia632_utt6,5,No, it's worse than that.
train/dia632_utt7,5,It's wrong.
train/dia632_utt8,2,It's... It is bigger than  mine!
train/dia632_utt9,0,I know.
train/dia632_utt10,6,You can't marry him!
train/dia632_utt11,6,Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
train/dia632_utt12,0,Well do you love him?
train/dia632_utt13,0,Sure.
train/dia632_utt14,0,Sure?
train/dia632_utt15,0,Yeah, I mean whatever.
train/dia632_utt16,6,Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?
train/dia632_utt17,6,No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
train/dia633_utt0,0,So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
train/dia633_utt1,1,Here comes the bride.
train/dia633_utt2,2,Oh my God Monica!
train/dia633_utt3,1,I wanna wear this everyday.
train/dia633_utt4,1,You look so beautiful.
train/dia633_utt5,1,I'm so happy for me.
train/dia633_utt6,0,Hello?
train/dia633_utt7,3,Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
train/dia633_utt8,0,Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
train/dia633_utt9,4,Damnit!
train/dia634_utt0,4,I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
train/dia634_utt1,0,Fine.
train/dia634_utt2,4,Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
train/dia634_utt3,4,And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
train/dia634_utt4,0,No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I
train/dia634_utt5,6,Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff!
train/dia634_utt6,0,And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
train/dia634_utt7,4,Crap!!
train/dia634_utt8,0,I gotta go!
train/dia635_utt0,2,Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
train/dia635_utt1,0,No.
train/dia635_utt2,2,Me neither! We have to get in!
train/dia635_utt3,0,Just act like you belong.
train/dia635_utt4,2,Oh my God! Oranges!
train/dia635_utt5,0,Shh!  Nice to see you again.
train/dia635_utt6,0,Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
train/dia635_utt7,0,Yes, of course.
train/dia635_utt8,0,I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.
train/dia635_utt9,0,Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
train/dia636_utt0,1,Okay!
train/dia636_utt1,0,Y'know what?
train/dia636_utt2,1,I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
train/dia636_utt3,0,All I really needed was a plan.
train/dia636_utt4,0,See I wanna have three kids
train/dia636_utt5,1,Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
train/dia636_utt6,0,As I was saying  I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years.
train/dia637_utt0,1,You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
train/dia637_utt1,4,Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
train/dia637_utt2,4,Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
train/dia637_utt3,4,Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
train/dia637_utt4,0,I don't know.
train/dia637_utt5,5,Why am I not surprised?
train/dia637_utt6,4,Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
train/dia637_utt7,0,I don't think you have much choice.
train/dia637_utt8,4,Well we'll see!
train/dia637_utt9,0,Bye-bye!
train/dia637_utt10,0,Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
train/dia637_utt11,0,Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
train/dia638_utt0,0,Dad?
train/dia638_utt1,0,I'm here!
train/dia638_utt2,2,Hey!
train/dia638_utt3,1,Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
train/dia638_utt4,6,Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
train/dia638_utt5,0,Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
train/dia638_utt6,0,Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
train/dia638_utt7,6,I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
train/dia638_utt8,1,Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories
train/dia638_utt9,0,Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven
train/dia638_utt10,0,I used to
train/dia638_utt11,0,Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
train/dia638_utt12,0,Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
train/dia639_utt0,0,Ok, got the vent open.
train/dia639_utt1,1,Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
train/dia639_utt2,0,Ben, you ready?
train/dia639_utt3,0,All right, gimme your foot.
train/dia639_utt4,0,Ok, on three, Ben.
train/dia639_utt5,0,One, two, three.
train/dia639_utt6,0,Ok, That's it, Ben.
train/dia639_utt7,0,What do you see?
train/dia639_utt8,0,Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
train/dia639_utt9,2,Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
train/dia639_utt10,2,Wait! You forgot your legs!
train/dia640_utt0,1,You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
train/dia640_utt1,1,Thank you.
train/dia640_utt2,0,Filing system?
train/dia640_utt3,2,Oh-oh!
train/dia640_utt4,0,You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
train/dia640_utt5,1,It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
train/dia640_utt6,0,Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
train/dia640_utt7,0,I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
train/dia640_utt8,1,Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
train/dia640_utt9,1,Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost
train/dia640_utt10,0,I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
train/dia640_utt11,1,Oh yes, well there's the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
train/dia640_utt12,0,Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
train/dia640_utt13,0,Yes, I realize that
train/dia640_utt14,0,And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
train/dia640_utt15,1,I love working with designers!
train/dia640_utt16,0,With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
train/dia641_utt0,0,Chandler, you have an assistant right?
train/dia641_utt1,3,Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
train/dia642_utt0,0,Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
train/dia642_utt1,2,I do?
train/dia642_utt2,0,Yeah!  All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
train/dia642_utt3,0,Okay.
train/dia642_utt4,0,Or not.
train/dia643_utt0,0,Where's Chandler?
train/dia643_utt1,0,Here I am.
train/dia643_utt2,5,Wash your hands!!!
train/dia643_utt3,2,How did you know?
train/dia643_utt4,2,Hey! What's she doing back here?
train/dia643_utt5,0,Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
train/dia643_utt6,0,Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
train/dia644_utt0,2,What happened in Atlantic City?!
train/dia644_utt1,0,Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
train/dia644_utt2,4,Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
train/dia644_utt3,0,And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
train/dia644_utt4,0,So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
train/dia644_utt5,1,Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls.
train/dia644_utt6,2,You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
train/dia644_utt7,4,In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
train/dia644_utt8,1,Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
train/dia644_utt9,4,Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
train/dia644_utt10,0,Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
train/dia645_utt0,0,So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
train/dia645_utt1,1,Of course I am!
train/dia645_utt2,0,Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.
train/dia645_utt3,0,I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
train/dia645_utt4,0,And-and then guess what?
train/dia645_utt5,6,The baby's coming and I don't know what to do.
train/dia645_utt6,6,Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
train/dia645_utt7,0,No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
train/dia645_utt8,3,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
train/dia645_utt9,0,I'm going to the bathroom.
train/dia645_utt10,0,Okay.
train/dia645_utt11,0,Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.
train/dia645_utt12,0,It
train/dia645_utt13,1,Hey!
train/dia645_utt14,2,Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
train/dia645_utt15,0,I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
train/dia645_utt16,0,Not if you were here.
train/dia646_utt0,0,Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
train/dia646_utt1,1,Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it's you!
train/dia646_utt2,0,I hope it's you.
train/dia646_utt3,1,Me too!
train/dia646_utt4,1,First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me
train/dia646_utt5,1,Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
train/dia646_utt6,0,Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
train/dia646_utt7,0,Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
train/dia646_utt8,1,Yes!!! Oh!!
train/dia646_utt9,4,Hypothetically!
train/dia646_utt10,0,Still.
train/dia646_utt11,0,If Phoebe were my maid of honor
train/dia646_utt12,0,Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
train/dia646_utt13,0,Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
train/dia646_utt14,0,Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
train/dia646_utt15,0,Well that's the best part. Umm,
train/dia646_utt16,2,Wh-why is that the best part?
train/dia646_utt17,1,Because then I don't have to!
train/dia646_utt18,0,Well of
train/dia646_utt19,1,I'm really not deciding!
train/dia646_utt20,4,Fine!
train/dia646_utt21,1,Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
train/dia647_utt0,0,If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
train/dia648_utt0,0,It's not just the drum noise.
train/dia648_utt1,4,Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
train/dia648_utt2,4,Oh god, my eye!"
train/dia648_utt3,4,I mean, it is so annoying.
train/dia648_utt4,0,Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
train/dia648_utt5,2,Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
train/dia648_utt6,0,Maybe on some level.
train/dia649_utt0,2,Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
train/dia649_utt1,0,No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
train/dia649_utt2,1,Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
train/dia649_utt3,1,And, a brownie!
train/dia649_utt4,0,Well, half a brownie.
train/dia649_utt5,0,Actually, it's just bag.
train/dia649_utt6,0,It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so
train/dia649_utt7,1,Oh man!
train/dia649_utt8,1,This is so great!
train/dia649_utt9,1,I actually feel like I'm going on a real date!
train/dia649_utt10,0,Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about  there.
train/dia649_utt11,0,Hey come on now, this is a real date.
train/dia649_utt12,0,Uh, so nice place you got here.
train/dia649_utt13,2,Foosball, huh?
train/dia649_utt14,0,Pizza box.
train/dia649_utt15,2,Oh, a subscription to
train/dia649_utt16,0,Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.
train/dia649_utt17,0,I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
train/dia649_utt18,0,Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
train/dia649_utt19,1,Ah  Hey, so this roommate of yours is he good looking?
train/dia649_utt20,0,Hm-mmm
train/dia649_utt21,0,Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
train/dia649_utt22,0,Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
train/dia649_utt23,4,No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
train/dia650_utt0,4,Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
train/dia650_utt1,0,Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
train/dia650_utt2,1,Ha. Ha, ha.
train/dia650_utt3,0,What?
train/dia650_utt4,0,Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.

train/dia651_utt1,2,He forgot to leave his grip size!
train/dia651_utt2,2,He didn't get the goggles!
train/dia651_utt3,0,Well,sounds like you two have issues.
train/dia651_utt4,0,Goodbye, baby.
train/dia651_utt5,0,Ciao, bela.
train/dia651_utt6,0,Do they wait for me to do this?
train/dia651_utt7,0,So are you gonna tell him?
train/dia651_utt8,0,Why would I tell him?
train/dia651_utt9,0,How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.

train/dia651_utt11,2,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
train/dia651_utt12,0,...What did I ask?
train/dia652_utt0,5,God. I feel violated.
train/dia652_utt1,5,Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
train/dia652_utt2,0,Ross, ten o'clock.
train/dia652_utt3,6,Is it? Feels like two.
train/dia652_utt4,0,No,
train/dia652_utt5,1,There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
train/dia652_utt6,1,Oh. Hel-lo!
train/dia652_utt7,1,She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
train/dia652_utt8,1,Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
train/dia652_utt9,3,Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
train/dia652_utt10,1,Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
train/dia652_utt11,0,Oh please, could she
train/dia652_utt12,0,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
train/dia652_utt13,0,Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
train/dia652_utt14,1,You could do that!
train/dia652_utt15,2,You think?
train/dia653_utt0,0,OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
train/dia653_utt1,0,OK.

train/dia654_utt6,0,Okay.
train/dia654_utt7,0,So, are we going in there?
train/dia654_utt8,1,I am!!
train/dia655_utt0,2,Wow!
train/dia655_utt1,0,It actually is in the handbook.
train/dia655_utt2,0,I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.
train/dia655_utt3,6,I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
train/dia655_utt4,1,For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
train/dia655_utt5,0,I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
train/dia655_utt6,2,Wow!
train/dia655_utt7,2,What?
train/dia655_utt8,1,Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
train/dia655_utt9,2,Really?
train/dia655_utt10,0,Yeah.
train/dia655_utt11,1,Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
train/dia655_utt12,1,Stop it!
train/dia655_utt13,1,No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
train/dia655_utt14,1,Shut the book!
train/dia655_utt15,1,Let's also get a hot plate!
train/dia656_utt0,1,Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends
train/dia657_utt0,1,Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
train/dia657_utt1,0,Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
train/dia657_utt2,0,I do the same thing.
train/dia657_utt3,1,I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25
train/dia657_utt4,1,I'm just kidding too.  I'm getting married in December.
train/dia657_utt5,0,So when are you getting married?
train/dia657_utt6,0,Oh May 15
train/dia657_utt7,1,Oooh it's getting close!
train/dia657_utt8,0,So uh, who's your photographer?
train/dia657_utt9,0,Jeffrey
train/dia657_utt10,0,We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
train/dia657_utt11,2,The best man? Wow!
train/dia657_utt12,1,I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
train/dia657_utt13,0,Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
train/dia657_utt14,6,Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
train/dia657_utt15,1,Ooh, is that spelled with a  C' or a  K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
train/dia657_utt16,0,Oh y'know what?
train/dia657_utt17,0,Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off.
train/dia657_utt18,5,This place is so overpriced.
train/dia657_utt19,0,So, does this  come in another color or
train/dia658_utt0,0,I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.
train/dia658_utt1,2,It was unbelievable!
train/dia658_utt2,1,We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
train/dia658_utt3,0,So have you called her yet?
train/dia658_utt4,3,Let her know I like her?
train/dia658_utt5,4,What are you, insane?
train/dia658_utt6,1,It's the next day!
train/dia658_utt7,0,How needy do I want to seem?
train/dia658_utt8,0,I'm right, right?
train/dia658_utt9,0,Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
train/dia658_utt10,2,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
train/dia658_utt11,4,Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
train/dia658_utt12,0,Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
train/dia658_utt13,0,Her answer machine?
train/dia658_utt14,0,No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
train/dia658_utt15,0,So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
train/dia658_utt16,5,Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
train/dia658_utt17,2,Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
train/dia658_utt18,0,Okay, okay, what's going on?
train/dia658_utt19,0,Okay, they're just talking...
train/dia658_utt20,0,Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
train/dia659_utt0,0,So, um, what do you do for a living?
train/dia659_utt1,0,Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
train/dia659_utt2,0,Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
train/dia659_utt3,6,I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
train/dia659_utt4,0,Now that is funny.
train/dia659_utt5,0,Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
train/dia659_utt6,6,Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
train/dia659_utt7,0,I guess.
train/dia659_utt8,0,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
train/dia659_utt9,0,Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
train/dia659_utt10,0,Come on.
train/dia659_utt11,0,These people'll scooch down.
train/dia659_utt12,0,You guys'll scooch, won't you?
train/dia659_utt13,1,Let's try scooching!
train/dia659_utt14,0,Come on.
train/dia659_utt15,0,Come on.
train/dia659_utt16,0,Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
train/dia659_utt17,0,Carol, Kristin.
train/dia659_utt18,0,Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.
train/dia659_utt19,1,And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
train/dia660_utt0,0,Okay.
train/dia660_utt1,0,When I was six years old.
train/dia660_utt2,0,Hm-mm
train/dia660_utt3,0,I wanted a big wheel.
train/dia660_utt4,4,And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
train/dia660_utt5,6,It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.
train/dia660_utt6,6,That was a pretty tough year.
train/dia660_utt7,1,That's-that's great!
train/dia660_utt8,0,See?
train/dia660_utt9,1,I already feel like I know you a little better!
train/dia660_utt10,1,Thank you.
train/dia660_utt11,0,Okay, come on.
train/dia660_utt12,0,Now we can go eat.
train/dia660_utt13,0,Let's go.
train/dia660_utt14,6,It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
train/dia660_utt15,2,Oh!
train/dia661_utt0,4,Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
train/dia661_utt1,2,That's patio furniture!
train/dia661_utt2,0,So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
train/dia661_utt3,0,What about the birds?
train/dia661_utt4,0,I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
train/dia661_utt5,0,You pick one.
train/dia661_utt6,0,All right, how about the ladybugs?
train/dia661_utt7,4,Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
train/dia661_utt8,4,Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
train/dia661_utt9,6,Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!
train/dia662_utt0,0,Bijan for men?
train/dia662_utt1,0,Bijan for men?
train/dia662_utt2,0,Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.

train/dia664_utt3,6,Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
train/dia664_utt4,4,Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
train/dia664_utt5,0,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
train/dia664_utt6,0,Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
train/dia664_utt7,0,Why? What happened to him?
train/dia664_utt8,0,Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
train/dia665_utt0,0,It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
train/dia665_utt1,1,Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
train/dia665_utt2,0,Well, okay, so what's now go get, go get the eggs, put  em in there.
train/dia665_utt3,0,Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
train/dia665_utt4,2,Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
train/dia665_utt5,0,Um-hmm, five actually.
train/dia665_utt6,0,Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
train/dia665_utt7,0,We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
train/dia665_utt8,2,That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
train/dia665_utt9,0,Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
train/dia665_utt10,0,Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
train/dia665_utt11,0,Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys,  cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
train/dia665_utt12,0,Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
train/dia665_utt13,0,Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.
train/dia665_utt14,0,So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
train/dia665_utt15,5,Whoa!! That okay, that's a
train/dia665_utt16,0,No, I'm sorry.
train/dia665_utt17,2,Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
train/dia665_utt18,4,I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
train/dia666_utt0,0,Hey!
train/dia666_utt1,0,Hey!
train/dia666_utt2,2,You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
train/dia666_utt3,5,Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
train/dia666_utt4,4,Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
train/dia666_utt5,0,I don't know, clean places?
train/dia666_utt6,0,Mm, yum!
train/dia666_utt7,0,It's Danny.

train/dia666_utt10,2,What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
train/dia666_utt11,4,The fake kind!

train/dia666_utt16,0,Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
train/dia667_utt0,1,You're so efficient. I love you!
train/dia667_utt1,1,Let's go!
train/dia667_utt2,6,No-no-no! We need something old!
train/dia667_utt3,0,Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
train/dia667_utt4,1,That'll work!
train/dia667_utt5,0,I don't think so.
train/dia667_utt6,1,Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
train/dia667_utt7,0,Here just take this.
train/dia667_utt8,6,That's stealing!
train/dia667_utt9,0,No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.

train/dia669_utt4,0,Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
train/dia670_utt0,1,Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.
train/dia670_utt1,4,Oh God, oh.
train/dia670_utt2,6,Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
train/dia670_utt3,4,Monica? Monica!
train/dia670_utt4,1,Water rules!
train/dia670_utt5,0,Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
train/dia670_utt6,0,Nope. Going to the
train/dia670_utt7,4,Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
train/dia670_utt8,1,No, it is me!
train/dia670_utt9,4,Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
train/dia670_utt10,1,Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.
train/dia670_utt11,1,I'm- I'm Monana!
train/dia670_utt12,0,Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
train/dia670_utt13,1,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
train/dia670_utt14,0,What?
train/dia670_utt15,6,They've arrested Monica.
train/dia671_utt0,0,Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
train/dia671_utt1,0,Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
train/dia671_utt2,0,No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
train/dia671_utt3,0,Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.
train/dia671_utt4,0,I just...
train/dia671_utt5,0,I wrote that out phonetically for you.
train/dia671_utt6,0,Phonetically?
train/dia671_utt7,0,Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
train/dia671_utt8,2,Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
train/dia671_utt9,1,Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
train/dia671_utt10,2,Wow. What does
train/dia671_utt11,2,No idea!
train/dia671_utt12,0,But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
train/dia671_utt13,0,Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
train/dia671_utt14,0,Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
train/dia671_utt15,4,Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't
train/dia671_utt16,0,Come on! you...

train/dia672_utt2,1,Done!
train/dia672_utt3,2,You just finished?
train/dia672_utt4,0,Well, I wanted to be thorough.
train/dia672_utt5,1,I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!
train/dia672_utt6,1,And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
train/dia672_utt7,0,So umm, does it?
train/dia672_utt8,6,I'm sorry.
train/dia672_utt9,3,Does it?
train/dia672_utt10,0,Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole  Does it?' part just another glance.
train/dia672_utt11,4,What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
train/dia672_utt12,4,Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even
train/dia672_utt13,0,No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't
train/dia672_utt14,1,Are you sure?
train/dia672_utt15,1,Oh, sure! I'm sure.
train/dia673_utt0,0,You got married again.
train/dia673_utt1,0,Yes.
train/dia673_utt2,0,So that's your second marriage in two years.
train/dia673_utt3,0,Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
train/dia673_utt4,0,Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.
train/dia673_utt5,0,Why don't you tell me what happened.
train/dia673_utt6,0,Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
train/dia673_utt7,2,I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
train/dia673_utt8,0,Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do
train/dia673_utt9,0,Oh, that's better then.
train/dia673_utt10,0,This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
train/dia673_utt11,0,I see. Have you considered therapy?
train/dia673_utt12,0,I think just the
train/dia673_utt13,0,There are a couple of forms to fill out.
train/dia673_utt14,0,Easy.
train/dia673_utt15,0,And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
train/dia673_utt16,0,No problem.
train/dia673_utt17,0,And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
train/dia673_utt18,2,Ooh!
train/dia673_utt19,2,There's no way to do this without her?
train/dia673_utt20,3, Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
train/dia674_utt0,0,So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
train/dia674_utt1,0,But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
train/dia674_utt2,0,Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
train/dia674_utt3,2,What?
train/dia674_utt4,0,Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
train/dia674_utt5,0,That's alright, I'll take it.
train/dia674_utt6,0,Bad things happen to me anyway.
train/dia674_utt7,0,This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
train/dia674_utt8,0,Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...

train/dia676_utt4,3,Oh God.
train/dia676_utt5,6,Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?

train/dia678_utt17,0,And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
train/dia678_utt18,0,You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
train/dia679_utt0,0,Okay, Chandler!
train/dia679_utt1,0,Okay.
train/dia679_utt2,1,And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."

train/dia680_utt0,1,Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
train/dia680_utt1,2,Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
train/dia680_utt2,2,I know!
train/dia680_utt3,1,Now look, there's only one problem though.
train/dia680_utt4,0,There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
train/dia680_utt5,6,Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
train/dia680_utt6,0,Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
train/dia680_utt7,0,Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.

train/dia738_utt5,2,What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
train/dia738_utt6,4,I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!

train/dia739_utt16,0,But you haven't even heard the chorus!
train/dia740_utt0,6,Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
train/dia740_utt1,0,Dad, that won't matter to her.
train/dia740_utt2,4,Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!
train/dia740_utt3,4,See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
train/dia740_utt4,2,Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
train/dia740_utt5,6,Well, can you blame her?
train/dia740_utt6,1,Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could

train/dia744_utt0,0,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it
train/dia744_utt1,0,Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.

train/dia745_utt4,0,Hey.
train/dia745_utt5,0,Hey, man. What's up?

train/dia745_utt11,4,Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!
train/dia746_utt0,0,See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
train/dia747_utt0,0,Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
train/dia747_utt1,2,Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

train/dia754_utt0,6,It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
train/dia754_utt1,5,That, that's what's stupid.
train/dia754_utt2,0,I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
train/dia754_utt3,0,And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
train/dia754_utt4,4,Down at the docks again?

train/dia757_utt0,2,So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
train/dia757_utt1,0,Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
train/dia757_utt2,0,Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary  Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
train/dia757_utt3,0,But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.

train/dia759_utt10,4,What woman?!
train/dia759_utt11,0,Chelsea.
train/dia759_utt12,5,Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
train/dia759_utt13,5,Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
train/dia759_utt14,6,So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
train/dia759_utt15,1,Can I be that guy?
train/dia760_utt0,1,Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!

train/dia763_utt7,4,Yeah! Oh yes!
train/dia763_utt8,0,Ohh.
train/dia763_utt9,1,Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
train/dia763_utt10,1,That's a great idea! We can
train/dia764_utt0,1,Totally!
train/dia765_utt0,0,We don't have to come up with this now.

train/dia766_utt4,0,Who said you were?
train/dia766_utt5,4,You did!
train/dia766_utt6,0,Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
train/dia767_utt0,1,Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
train/dia767_utt1,0,That does not sound stupid to me.
train/dia767_utt2,0,You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
train/dia767_utt3,6,I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
train/dia767_utt4,0,Next on Ross... Uh-oh.

train/dia767_utt10,4,Ross, what's the matter?
train/dia767_utt11,0,Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
train/dia768_utt0,2,Why are you here?
train/dia768_utt1,6,Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...

train/dia768_utt7,0,Please... go!  Just let me know if you    need a hand!

train/dia770_utt7,4,Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
train/dia770_utt8,5,Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
train/dia770_utt9,4,Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
train/dia770_utt10,4,Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
train/dia770_utt11,4,Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
train/dia770_utt12,4,I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
train/dia770_utt13,4,Do not speak ill of the dead.
train/dia770_utt14,4,We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
train/dia770_utt15,6,I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
train/dia770_utt16,4,What did you say?
train/dia770_utt17,3,I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
train/dia771_utt0,0,Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
train/dia771_utt1,0,Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y'know, technically we still
train/dia771_utt2,0,I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
train/dia771_utt3,0, Kay!
train/dia771_utt4,0,Can I ask you something?
train/dia771_utt5,0,Uhh, no.
train/dia771_utt6,0,Felicity and I, we're watching
train/dia771_utt7,0,No.
train/dia771_utt8,0,I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
train/dia771_utt9,0,Yes.
train/dia771_utt10,0,Thanks man.
train/dia771_utt11,0,Okay man.
train/dia771_utt12,0,But what about how much taller he is than me?
train/dia771_utt13,0,I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know?
train/dia771_utt14,4,And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
train/dia771_utt15,2,Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
train/dia771_utt16,4,I know!

train/dia777_utt7,2,Hey, y'know what?
train/dia777_utt8,0,Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.

train/dia782_utt5,0,Oh, okay.
train/dia782_utt6,3,I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you.
train/dia782_utt7,1,But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it.
train/dia782_utt8,3,But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime.
train/dia782_utt9,3,So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.

train/dia784_utt0,0,Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
train/dia784_utt1,6,Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so

train/dia785_utt1,4,What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!
train/dia786_utt0,0,Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
train/dia786_utt1,4,Are you kidding me?!

train/dia786_utt3,4,I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!

train/dia787_utt6,0,You're hot.
train/dia787_utt7,0,I'm lovable.
train/dia787_utt8,0,Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.
train/dia787_utt9,0,But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
train/dia787_utt10,0,Joey...
train/dia788_utt0,3,Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm
train/dia788_utt1,1,Ho-oh, he's gonna get some!

train/dia788_utt4,0,Well, I'm off to bed!
train/dia789_utt0,1,You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!

train/dia789_utt7,4,Okay?
train/dia789_utt8,1,But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very
train/dia789_utt9,2,Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
train/dia790_utt0,2,Oh, Joey! Sorry!
train/dia791_utt0,1,They made you head of the department!
train/dia791_utt1,1,No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didn't I get head of the department?
train/dia791_utt2,0,Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm

train/dia791_utt10,0,Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
train/dia791_utt11,1,I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun!
train/dia791_utt12,0,I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
train/dia791_utt13,0,Hey, y'know what?
train/dia791_utt14,0,Huh?
train/dia791_utt15,0,Why don't I take you out?
train/dia791_utt16,2,What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
train/dia791_utt17,1,Yes I do!
train/dia791_utt18,1,And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
train/dia791_utt19,1,Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
train/dia791_utt20,0,I'll be fun.

train/dia792_utt0,1,Hi!
train/dia792_utt1,1,Hey!
train/dia792_utt2,0,Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking
train/dia792_utt3,1,Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good
train/dia792_utt4,1,God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
train/dia792_utt5,2,Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?
train/dia792_utt6,5,Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
train/dia792_utt7,0,Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
train/dia792_utt8,4,Oh screw her, that part is mine!
train/dia792_utt9,0,Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
train/dia792_utt10,2,Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.
train/dia792_utt11,2,I can't believe you married him.
train/dia792_utt12,4,But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
train/dia792_utt13,6,So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
train/dia792_utt14,1,It's over! You
train/dia792_utt15,2,How can I?
train/dia792_utt16,6,Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
train/dia792_utt17,6,How can I accept that...
train/dia792_utt18,6,I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
train/dia792_utt19,1,Kiss me.
train/dia792_utt20,2,What?
train/dia793_utt0,1,Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
train/dia793_utt1,0,The bigger half.
train/dia793_utt2,1,I'd like to propose a toast.
train/dia793_utt3,1,Little toast here, ding ding.
train/dia793_utt4,1,I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
train/dia793_utt5,4,Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
train/dia793_utt6,1,So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
train/dia793_utt7,1,That's so sweet.
train/dia793_utt8,1,And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
train/dia793_utt9,1,And a crappy New Year.
train/dia793_utt10,1,Here, here!
train/dia794_utt0,4,Now, hold on!
train/dia794_utt1,4,Hold on!
train/dia794_utt2,4,Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too!
train/dia794_utt3,4,Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay?
train/dia794_utt4,4,She's-she's just a friend and that's all!
train/dia794_utt5,6,That's all!
train/dia794_utt6,4,Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
train/dia794_utt7,6,Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
train/dia794_utt8,4,All right, I'll tell her.  Come on bugger face!
train/dia794_utt9,0,Call me.
train/dia794_utt10,4,You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
train/dia795_utt0,2,What happened?!!
train/dia795_utt1,2,Well, I don't know!!
train/dia795_utt2,0,We fell asleep! That is all.
train/dia795_utt3,0,Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
train/dia795_utt4,0,I think that would be best.
train/dia795_utt5,0,Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
train/dia795_utt6,4,Okay. But not about this!
train/dia795_utt7,4,No! Never! Never!  Bye.
train/dia795_utt8,0,No touch! No touch!
train/dia796_utt0,6,Umm ma'am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
train/dia796_utt1,2,What?
train/dia796_utt2,0,It's a funny story, actually.
train/dia796_utt3,0,I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really  know what I was saying.
train/dia796_utt4,2,You fell asleep?
train/dia796_utt5,3,But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain't that funny?
train/dia796_utt6,2,Irony?
train/dia796_utt7,0,Not a fan, alright .
train/dia796_utt8,0,See, here's  the thing.
train/dia796_utt9,0,I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.
train/dia796_utt10,1,See, me, I  love Tulsa!
train/dia796_utt11,1,Tulsa is heaven!
train/dia796_utt12,3,Tulsa is Italy—Please don't make me go  there!
train/dia796_utt13,1,Chandler, I...
train/dia796_utt14,3,No no no!
train/dia796_utt15,0,Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
train/dia796_utt16,1,Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine?
train/dia796_utt17,1,Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping!
train/dia796_utt18,1,That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it,  well she's lovely.
train/dia796_utt19,6,I like a girl with a strong jaw.
train/dia796_utt20,0,I'll call you from Tulsa.
train/dia797_utt0,0,Hi.
train/dia797_utt1,0,Hey.
train/dia797_utt2,0,How are you?
train/dia797_utt3,0,I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
train/dia797_utt4,0,Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
train/dia797_utt5,2,That I was not expecting.
train/dia797_utt6,0,I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
train/dia797_utt7,0,Oh. Thanks.
train/dia797_utt8,1,No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing
train/dia797_utt9,0,Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
train/dia797_utt10,2,I just can't believe you're in here.
train/dia797_utt11,6,I mean, what am I gonna do without you?
train/dia797_utt12,6,Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
train/dia797_utt13,6,Who's gonna take me to the
train/dia798_utt0,5,Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.

train/dia798_utt6,2,Oh my.
train/dia799_utt0,3,Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
train/dia799_utt1,3,Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
train/dia799_utt2,0,Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
train/dia799_utt3,0,Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
train/dia799_utt4,0,My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
train/dia799_utt5,0,No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
train/dia799_utt6,0,Tho?
train/dia800_utt0,3,Ohhh.
train/dia800_utt1,0,That's good, have a seat.
train/dia801_utt0,0,Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.

train/dia801_utt3,0,Ok.
train/dia801_utt4,0,Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
train/dia801_utt5,3,Yes!

train/dia803_utt2,2,Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay?
train/dia803_utt3,1,It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
train/dia803_utt4,1,You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity!
train/dia803_utt5,1,That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
train/dia803_utt6,4,That means nothing to me.  Come on!
train/dia804_utt0,3,Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.

train/dia804_utt8,4,Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
train/dia804_utt9,6,Okay, I'm sorry.

train/dia813_utt5,6,And did you?!
train/dia813_utt6,0,No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.

train/dia817_utt8,0,Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?

train/dia817_utt14,0,Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
train/dia818_utt0,0,I mean, why should I let them meet him?
train/dia818_utt1,5,I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.
train/dia818_utt2,1,I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
train/dia818_utt3,0,Listen.
train/dia818_utt4,0,As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
train/dia818_utt5,0,I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
train/dia818_utt6,6,I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
train/dia818_utt7,0,Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
train/dia819_utt0,2,No-no-no-no.  Hey!
train/dia819_utt1,0,Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.

train/dia823_utt9,5,Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
train/dia823_utt10,0,What are you saying I should do?
train/dia823_utt11,0,I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
train/dia823_utt12,1,Thank you, Monica.
train/dia823_utt13,0,Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.

train/dia836_utt5,0,2:17.
train/dia836_utt6,2,Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
train/dia836_utt7,2,Are you serious?!
train/dia836_utt8,0,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
train/dia836_utt9,2,Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
train/dia836_utt10,4,Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!

train/dia839_utt4,1,Look, I'm talking right now! You're you mean her.

train/dia839_utt13,5,And shame on all of you!
train/dia839_utt14,5,You're disgusting!
train/dia839_utt15,5,Especially you  with that!
train/dia840_utt0,1,Hey!
train/dia840_utt1,1,Hi Pheebs!
train/dia840_utt2,0,Are you moving out?
train/dia840_utt3,0,No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
train/dia840_utt4,0,Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
train/dia840_utt5,0,Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
train/dia840_utt6,3,Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
train/dia840_utt7,1,Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
train/dia840_utt8,0,Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
train/dia840_utt9,0,One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
train/dia840_utt10,2,Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
train/dia840_utt11,0,Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
train/dia840_utt12,2,All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
train/dia840_utt13,0,Which proves that I never lie.
train/dia840_utt14,0,I guess you don't.
train/dia840_utt15,6,Paolo made a pass at me.
train/dia841_utt0,3,I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
train/dia841_utt1,0,I'm not freaking out.
train/dia841_utt2,0,Why would I be freaking out?
train/dia841_utt3,0,A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
train/dia841_utt4,4,Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!
train/dia841_utt5,0,I mean, what's the harm in that?
train/dia841_utt6,6,Right here!
train/dia841_utt7,4,Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
train/dia841_utt8,4,Phoebe and Rachel!
train/dia841_utt9,6,So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
train/dia841_utt10,6,It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
train/dia841_utt11,0,Okay.
train/dia841_utt12,1,Really?
train/dia841_utt13,0,Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready
train/dia841_utt14,0,I know! I know.
train/dia841_utt15,0,Okay.
train/dia841_utt16,4,I'm gonna go tell Joey that  that you're back. I was really worried about you.
train/dia841_utt17,0,Hey, did she buy it?
train/dia841_utt18,0,Totally.
train/dia841_utt19,0,So did Heldi show you the place?
train/dia841_utt20,0,Yeah, it's beautiful.
train/dia841_utt21,1,I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
train/dia841_utt22,0,I know.
train/dia842_utt0,0,Okay look, I have an idea.
train/dia842_utt1,0,Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
train/dia842_utt2,0,And then whoever does gets the phone.
train/dia842_utt3,0,All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
train/dia842_utt4,6,Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
train/dia842_utt5,6,Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
train/dia842_utt6,6,Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
train/dia842_utt7,0,Joe.
train/dia842_utt10,1,Oh, I win! He's got
train/dia842_utt11,0,So you don't know that's
train/dia842_utt12,2,His new girlfriend!
train/dia843_utt0,2,I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
train/dia843_utt1,6,I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
train/dia843_utt2,4,She's saving the rest for her divorce.
train/dia843_utt3,0,And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to
train/dia843_utt4,0,Well what happened at dinner?
train/dia843_utt5,4,My parents spent the money for our wedding!
train/dia843_utt6,2,My God! What did you order?!
train/dia843_utt7,6,Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
train/dia843_utt8,0,Honey, it's gonna be okay.
train/dia843_utt9,6,No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
train/dia843_utt10,0,No, y'know what?
train/dia843_utt11,0,It's gonna be okay.
train/dia843_utt12,0,I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast.
train/dia843_utt13,0,Y'know?
train/dia843_utt14,0,And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
train/dia844_utt0,0,Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
train/dia844_utt1,0,Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
train/dia844_utt2,0,I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
train/dia844_utt3,0,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
train/dia844_utt4,0,Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
train/dia844_utt5,6,Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division.
train/dia844_utt6,3,Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"
train/dia844_utt7,0,Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.
train/dia844_utt8,1,I'm Ross!
train/dia844_utt9,1,I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
train/dia844_utt10,1,I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
train/dia844_utt11,4,I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.

train/dia844_utt13,4,Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!

train/dia844_utt19,0,Yeah, okay, Scott!
train/dia844_utt20,3,And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
train/dia845_utt0,0,So thanks for the warm welcome.
train/dia845_utt1,1,It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.

train/dia848_utt11,2,OK, I need to lie down.
train/dia849_utt0,1,Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
train/dia849_utt1,1,Really? That's great!
train/dia849_utt2,1,I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
train/dia849_utt3,0,(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of
train/dia849_utt4,1,Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,
train/dia849_utt5,1,Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.
train/dia849_utt6,1,Ben is way cuter than that kid.
train/dia849_utt7,5,I mean look at him, look at you,
train/dia849_utt8,0,That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
train/dia849_utt9,0,Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
train/dia849_utt10,4,I look more like him than you do!
train/dia849_utt11,1,Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
train/dia850_utt0,1,That really was some of your best work.
train/dia850_utt1,0,Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
train/dia850_utt2,0,I have to be up in seven minutes.
train/dia850_utt3,0,Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
train/dia850_utt4,2,Really?!
train/dia850_utt5,0,Do you wanna?
train/dia850_utt6,1,Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
train/dia851_utt0,0,Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
train/dia851_utt1,2,Boyfriend?
train/dia851_utt2,0,No.
train/dia851_utt3,0,I'm Joey.
train/dia851_utt4,0,Kristen.

train/dia851_utt8,0,So uh, do you live around here?
train/dia851_utt9,0,Yeah!

train/dia851_utt12,0,Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip.
train/dia851_utt13,1,Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
train/dia851_utt14,0,I'll remember that.
train/dia851_utt15,0,Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
train/dia851_utt16,0,Oh I, I have plans tonight.
train/dia851_utt17,0,But how about tomorrow?
train/dia851_utt18,1,Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?

train/dia851_utt20,0,Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, I'll grab this one.
train/dia852_utt0,0,Hey.

train/dia852_utt2,6,I'm sorry.
train/dia852_utt3,0,: Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'
train/dia852_utt4,6,That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
train/dia852_utt5,0,Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
train/dia852_utt6,0,If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
train/dia852_utt7,4,Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
train/dia852_utt8,6,You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
train/dia853_utt0,0,By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
train/dia853_utt1,4,Oh, hello liar.
train/dia853_utt2,6,Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
train/dia853_utt3,4,I could've been killed I hope you know!
train/dia853_utt4,6,I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were
train/dia853_utt5,1,Well, I would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
train/dia853_utt6,0,Phoebe.
train/dia853_utt7,4,What?!  What the hell?!
train/dia853_utt8,4,All right, y'know what?
train/dia853_utt9,4,If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
train/dia853_utt10,2,What?! Why?!
train/dia853_utt11,4,Because! Because, it-it-it's  It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar
train/dia853_utt12,4,All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
train/dia853_utt13,1,Great! Great!  You're making the bike very happy.
train/dia853_utt14,4,Okay Ross!  Please don't die!
train/dia854_utt0,3,How could you have kept all of this from me?
train/dia854_utt1,0,I was going to tell you, but
train/dia854_utt2,4,But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
train/dia854_utt3,4,Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just   Why don't we just let the machine get that?
train/dia854_utt4,0,Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
train/dia854_utt5,0,No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I I need to, I need to lie down.
train/dia855_utt0,1,Everything on your application looks really good Ohh!
train/dia855_utt1,4,Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
train/dia855_utt2,0,Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
train/dia855_utt3,1,Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
train/dia855_utt4,1,You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I'll be living here.
train/dia855_utt5,6,Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
train/dia855_utt6,2,Why did you take the shower curtain down?
train/dia855_utt7,3,That thing was a hazard!  I'm very safety conscious.
train/dia856_utt0,0,Hi.
train/dia856_utt1,0,Hey man, how did the audition go?
train/dia856_utt2,6,Estelle said I didn't get it.
train/dia856_utt3,2,What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
train/dia856_utt4,1,Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
train/dia857_utt0,2,No!
train/dia857_utt1,0,For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around.
train/dia857_utt2,0,No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.
train/dia857_utt3,0,Right here.
train/dia857_utt4,0,Well, it's getting late.
train/dia857_utt5,0,Yeah, we're gonna go.
train/dia857_utt6,0,Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
train/dia857_utt7,0,Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
train/dia857_utt8,0,Yeah, it's a very large plane.
train/dia857_utt9,0,That's cool.
train/dia857_utt10,0,But, we'll stay here with you.
train/dia857_utt11,1,Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
train/dia858_utt0,2,Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
train/dia858_utt1,2,They're not a couple!
train/dia858_utt2,0,Oh-okay, I get the game now.
train/dia858_utt3,0,Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
train/dia858_utt4,1,Oh yeah!
train/dia858_utt5,0,Well okay, so then you're fine.
train/dia858_utt6,0,The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
train/dia858_utt7,0,Okay?
train/dia858_utt8,0,So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
train/dia858_utt9,0,It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
train/dia858_utt10,2,Really?
train/dia858_utt11,0,Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
train/dia858_utt12,0,No.
train/dia858_utt13,0,Noooo!!
train/dia859_utt0,2,Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
train/dia859_utt1,0,Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
train/dia859_utt2,2,Wait a second! So, what's new with you?
train/dia859_utt3,0,Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.
train/dia860_utt0,2,And your breasts! Hmm!!!
train/dia860_utt1,0,Okay.
train/dia860_utt2,3,Umm look, you're coming on a little strong.
train/dia860_utt3,0,But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.
train/dia860_utt4,0,So, why don't we just start over okay?
train/dia860_utt5,0,And you can just tell me about yourself.
train/dia860_utt6,0,All right.
train/dia860_utt7,0,Okay.
train/dia860_utt8,0,I write erotic novels, for children.
train/dia860_utt9,2,What?!
train/dia860_utt10,0,They're wildly unpopular.
train/dia860_utt11,5,Oh my God!
train/dia860_utt12,0,Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
train/dia860_utt13,2,Wow! You do?
train/dia860_utt14,1,Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
train/dia860_utt15,5,All right.
train/dia861_utt0,6,So, uh, how's she doing?
train/dia861_utt1,6,The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
train/dia861_utt2,6,How-how are you, Mom?
train/dia861_utt3,4,Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
train/dia861_utt4,2,What?
train/dia861_utt5,2,What's different?
train/dia861_utt6,0,Nothing.
train/dia861_utt7,0,Oh, maybe that's it.
train/dia861_utt8,4,She is unbelievable, our mother is...
train/dia861_utt9,0,Okay, relax, relax.
train/dia861_utt10,0,We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
train/dia861_utt11,2,Oh God!
train/dia861_utt12,0,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
train/dia861_utt13,2,Oh!
train/dia861_utt14,5,...Yeah, they were gross.
train/dia861_utt15,1,Oh, you know what I loved?
train/dia861_utt16,1,Her Sweet 'n' Los.
train/dia861_utt17,1,How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
train/dia861_utt18,0,Not just restaurants, from our house.
train/dia862_utt0,0,Maybe.
train/dia862_utt1,2,You can't!
train/dia862_utt2,2,Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
train/dia862_utt3,0,In the hall.
train/dia863_utt0,0,Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.
train/dia863_utt1,0,But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
train/dia863_utt2,0,Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
train/dia863_utt3,0,Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
train/dia863_utt4,1,That's a good one!

train/dia864_utt1,0,Anything at all.
train/dia864_utt2,0,But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
train/dia864_utt3,1,Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
train/dia864_utt4,4,I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
train/dia865_utt0,0,Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.
train/dia865_utt1,4,Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut.  Hi!
train/dia865_utt2,0,I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
train/dia865_utt3,4,Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A

train/dia865_utt5,1,So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
train/dia865_utt6,0,Okay, you're fine.
train/dia866_utt0,2,Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
train/dia866_utt1,0,You'll see.
train/dia866_utt2,1,I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
train/dia866_utt3,0,Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
train/dia866_utt4,0,And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and   You go.
train/dia866_utt5,0,But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time.
train/dia866_utt6,0,Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
train/dia866_utt7,1,It's perfect.
train/dia866_utt8,1,And, I don't know, if it starts to rain
train/dia866_utt9,4,Well then we'll get wet.
train/dia866_utt10,6,Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
train/dia867_utt0,0,Coming.
train/dia867_utt1,4,I have a bone to pick with you.

train/dia867_utt6,0,Oh that.
train/dia867_utt7,4,Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
train/dia868_utt0,4,Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
train/dia868_utt1,0,Okay.
train/dia868_utt2,0,And if it were true, how
train/dia868_utt3,0,Ms. Monroe   Oh there you go.
train/dia869_utt0,2,Mark's a genius!
train/dia869_utt1,2,Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
train/dia869_utt2,4,Look, don't you see what's happening here.
train/dia869_utt3,4,Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
train/dia869_utt4,0,Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
train/dia869_utt5,3,What am I going to do?
train/dia869_utt6,0,Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
train/dia869_utt7,0,All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
train/dia869_utt8,3,I don't know you guys.
train/dia869_utt9,5,All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
train/dia869_utt10,5,And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
train/dia869_utt11,4,And before you know it, she's with him.
train/dia869_utt12,4,And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
train/dia869_utt13,4,And he'll be all, 'Yes!'
train/dia869_utt14,1,And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
train/dia869_utt15,5,And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
train/dia869_utt16,5,And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
train/dia869_utt17,0,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
train/dia870_utt0,0,This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
train/dia870_utt1,0,Great. Great.
train/dia870_utt2,0,Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther  cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
train/dia870_utt3,0,I'll be there.
train/dia870_utt4,0,Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
train/dia870_utt5,0,Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
train/dia870_utt6,0,Okay! We'll need a six-pack of
train/dia870_utt7,0,Hey guys, what are you doing?
train/dia871_utt0,0,Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.
train/dia871_utt1,6,Oh, come on!
train/dia871_utt2,0,Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
train/dia871_utt3,0,Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
train/dia871_utt4,0,Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
train/dia871_utt5,0,I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there.
train/dia871_utt6,0,And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
train/dia871_utt7,0,What do ya say? What do ya say?
train/dia871_utt8,0,Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
train/dia871_utt9,0,But, all right, I don't maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
train/dia871_utt10,6,I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
train/dia872_utt0,6,What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
train/dia872_utt1,2,I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
train/dia872_utt2,1,Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
train/dia872_utt3,2,What's that supposed to mean?
train/dia872_utt4,0,Nothing! It's an expression.
train/dia872_utt5,0,No it's not.
train/dia872_utt6,0,Don't listen to your mother.
train/dia872_utt7,0,You're independent, and you always have been!
train/dia872_utt8,0,Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
train/dia872_utt9,0,And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
train/dia873_utt0,0,PBS Telethon.
train/dia873_utt1,0,Hi Joey.
train/dia873_utt2,1,Hey Pheebs!
train/dia873_utt3,0,I
train/dia873_utt4,2,$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what
train/dia873_utt5,4,Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
train/dia874_utt0,2,What kind of problem?
train/dia874_utt1,6,Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
train/dia874_utt2,2,Oh my God!
train/dia874_utt3,6,Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
train/dia874_utt4,6,Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
train/dia874_utt5,6,I don't wanna give up the bag.
train/dia874_utt6,4,I don't have to give up the bag!
train/dia874_utt7,6,Do I Rach?
train/dia874_utt8,4,Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
train/dia874_utt9,0,Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
train/dia874_utt10,6,I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
train/dia874_utt11,6,I can't believe I'm hearing this!
train/dia874_utt12,6,Wait a minute!
train/dia874_utt13,4,Wait a minute!
train/dia874_utt14,0,I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
train/dia874_utt15,0,Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
train/dia875_utt0,0,I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
train/dia875_utt1,1,Okay, great.
train/dia875_utt2,0,They say he's only got half a tank left.
train/dia875_utt3,2,Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
train/dia875_utt4,4,We're switching rooms again.
train/dia875_utt5,2,What? Why?
train/dia875_utt6,4,This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
train/dia875_utt7,1,Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
train/dia875_utt8,4,Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
train/dia875_utt9,0,Uh-huh.
train/dia875_utt10,0,Chandler!
train/dia876_utt0,4,Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
train/dia876_utt1,4,Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
train/dia876_utt2,2,Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
train/dia877_utt0,1,Hey!
train/dia877_utt1,2,Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
train/dia877_utt2,1,Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
train/dia877_utt3,1,Well, I'm very glad you're here.
train/dia877_utt4,1,Oh, you're such a gentleman.  Come on! We're going to my place!
train/dia878_utt0,1,Hey!
train/dia878_utt1,0,Hey-hey.
train/dia878_utt2,0,So are guys doing okay?
train/dia878_utt3,0,Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
train/dia879_utt0,0,Do you have a minute?
train/dia879_utt1,0,Well yeah, sure, what's up?
train/dia879_utt2,0,I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch by guys.
train/dia880_utt0,2,Oh really?!
train/dia880_utt1,0,Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
train/dia880_utt2,1,Oh, did you not want people to know that?
train/dia881_utt0,1,But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
train/dia882_utt0,0,Why's that?
train/dia883_utt0,0,I don't think I should say.
train/dia883_utt1,0,Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
train/dia883_utt2,0,Okay.
train/dia883_utt3,0, Kay.
train/dia883_utt4,0,Well
train/dia883_utt5,0,Yeah.
train/dia883_utt6,0,I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
train/dia883_utt7,0,Yeah, she's gay.
train/dia884_utt0,0,Here you go.
train/dia884_utt1,1,Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
train/dia884_utt2,1,Great!
train/dia884_utt3,2,Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
train/dia884_utt4,0,That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
train/dia884_utt5,2,Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
train/dia884_utt6,0,No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
train/dia884_utt7,2,What?
train/dia884_utt8,4,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
train/dia884_utt9,2,Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
train/dia884_utt10,2,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
train/dia884_utt11,5,Well, I'm upset for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
train/dia884_utt12,6,What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
train/dia884_utt13,4,Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
train/dia884_utt14,0,But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
train/dia884_utt15,2,You got all that from the back of her head?
train/dia884_utt16,0,All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
train/dia884_utt17,0,Who's Elaine?
train/dia885_utt0,1,Can you people not see me?!
train/dia885_utt1,0,So, will you talk to him?
train/dia885_utt2,0,I don't know Rach.
train/dia885_utt3,4,Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free
train/dia885_utt4,4,One!  No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
train/dia886_utt0,1,Hey!
train/dia886_utt1,1,Hi!
train/dia886_utt2,0,Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
train/dia886_utt3,0,We need a porn break.
train/dia886_utt4,0,We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
train/dia886_utt5,1,Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
train/dia886_utt6,0,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
train/dia886_utt7,1,Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
train/dia886_utt8,1,Hey!
train/dia886_utt9,1,Hi!
train/dia886_utt10,1,Well, what-what  cha got there?
train/dia886_utt11,1,Oh this, well I'm glad you asked.
train/dia886_utt12,5,Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
train/dia886_utt13,0,Ahh!
train/dia886_utt14,0,Now, I know what you're thinking
train/dia886_utt15,3,Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
train/dia886_utt16,2,Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
train/dia886_utt17,1,No!
train/dia886_utt20,0,Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
train/dia886_utt21,0,No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
train/dia886_utt22,0,What's the second part of your plan?
train/dia887_utt0,0,Yes that's right.
train/dia887_utt1,2,Why?
train/dia887_utt2,0,I tired attacking two women, did not work.
train/dia887_utt3,2,What?!
train/dia887_utt4,0,No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends.
train/dia887_utt5,4,In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
train/dia887_utt6,4,Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
train/dia887_utt7,2,Oh, no!
train/dia887_utt8,2,No-no!
train/dia887_utt9,2,No, I tired!
train/dia887_utt10,0,But I couldn't.
train/dia887_utt11,4,That's why I'm here.
train/dia887_utt12,0,Maybe we could attack them together?
train/dia887_utt13,0,That-that's a no.
train/dia888_utt0,6,What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
train/dia888_utt1,4,Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
train/dia888_utt2,4,I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
train/dia888_utt3,4,All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
train/dia888_utt4,0,No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
train/dia888_utt5,0,No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
train/dia888_utt6,1,I like that.
train/dia888_utt7,0,Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
train/dia888_utt8,0,Huh?
train/dia888_utt9,0,One swift kick and he'll back off.
train/dia888_utt10,0,All right, bad ankle, got it!
train/dia888_utt11,0,And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.
train/dia888_utt12,0,Yeah.
train/dia888_utt13,0,And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
train/dia888_utt14,1,Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
train/dia888_utt15,0,And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
train/dia888_utt16,1,But-but, Liam's on my team.
train/dia888_utt17,4,I don't care! You just get him!
train/dia888_utt18,1,I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
train/dia888_utt19,1,The Red Ross! Okay.
train/dia889_utt0,0,Oh!  Oh by the way?
train/dia889_utt1,0,Uh-hmm.
train/dia889_utt2,0,James Brolin?
train/dia889_utt3,0,Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.
train/dia889_utt4,0,Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
train/dia889_utt5,2,Really?!
train/dia890_utt0,0,Hello?
train/dia890_utt1,0,Hello, is Ross there?
train/dia890_utt2,0,Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
train/dia890_utt3,0,Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
train/dia890_utt4,2,Ross got married again Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
train/dia891_utt0,1,Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
train/dia891_utt1,0,Oh!  She's growing inside you.

train/dia892_utt4,0,No, this is a much better job.
train/dia892_utt5,0,It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
train/dia892_utt6,2,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
train/dia892_utt7,0,That's what I do now.

train/dia892_utt12,0,No.
train/dia892_utt13,0,He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.
train/dia892_utt14,1,Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!
train/dia892_utt15,1,"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
train/dia892_utt16,6,The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
train/dia893_utt0,0,So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
train/dia893_utt1,5,No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.

train/dia893_utt8,0,So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
train/dia893_utt9,4,I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts!
train/dia893_utt10,1,Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
train/dia893_utt11,0,That is true.
train/dia893_utt12,1,Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
train/dia893_utt13,1,It'll be me!
train/dia893_utt14,1,And I swear I'll do a really good job.
train/dia893_utt15,1,Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
train/dia893_utt16,1,It might be kinda cool.
train/dia893_utt17,1,So I can do it?
train/dia894_utt0,1,Ah-ha! Too cocky!
train/dia895_utt0,3,I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
train/dia895_utt1,0,Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
train/dia895_utt2,4,What the hell is that?
train/dia895_utt3,2,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
train/dia895_utt4,0,You said there was a gas leak in here.
train/dia895_utt5,0,Well why don't you use your key?
train/dia895_utt6,0,Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.
train/dia895_utt7,0,If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.
train/dia895_utt8,4,Come on!
train/dia895_utt9,6,Hurry up.
train/dia895_utt10,0,Oh! We could have done that.
train/dia896_utt0,0,Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
train/dia896_utt1,6,Oh, I'm so sorry.
train/dia896_utt2,6,Um, and maybe I'm wrong!
train/dia896_utt3,0,I but y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.
train/dia896_utt4,2,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
train/dia896_utt5,0,Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
train/dia897_utt0,4,Oh, but it's made her so happy.
train/dia897_utt1,0,Little girl misses her cat.

train/dia903_utt1,1,Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was the first time I knew that you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
train/dia903_utt2,4,Oh crap!
train/dia904_utt0,0,All right.
train/dia904_utt1,0,The super couldn't figure out what it did.
train/dia904_utt2,6,A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did.
train/dia904_utt3,6,I've had seven pretty serious shocks.
train/dia904_utt4,5,I officially give up.
train/dia904_utt5,1,Thank God.
train/dia904_utt6,1,I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.

train/dia908_utt5,0,What? Is it the comet?
train/dia908_utt6,2,No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
train/dia908_utt7,4,Joey come I can't believe I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
train/dia908_utt8,0,Y'know, there's
train/dia908_utt9,0,Show me where?
train/dia908_utt10,0,Right-right up here.

train/dia908_utt13,4,Joey!
train/dia908_utt14,4,What?! All right Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
train/dia908_utt15,4,It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
train/dia908_utt16,2,Oh no! No! No!
train/dia909_utt0,1,Wow! This place is incredible!  Sting's pen that he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!
train/dia909_utt1,0,Hi!
train/dia909_utt2,0,Hi!
train/dia909_utt3,0,I'm Trudie.
train/dia909_utt4,0,Uh-huh.
train/dia909_utt5,0,You must be Ben's mum.
train/dia909_utt6,0,Why else would I be here?
train/dia909_utt7,0,Do sit down.
train/dia909_utt8,0,Yeah.
train/dia910_utt0,0,Hi.. how was the game?
train/dia910_utt1,0,Well..
train/dia910_utt2,1,WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
train/dia910_utt3,2,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
train/dia910_utt4,0,Alan.
train/dia910_utt5,1,He was unbelievable.
train/dia910_utt6,1,He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
train/dia910_utt7,1,I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
train/dia910_utt8,1,Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
train/dia910_utt9,0,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
train/dia910_utt10,2,What?
train/dia910_utt11,0,..I dunno, a little too Alan?
train/dia910_utt12,1,Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
train/dia910_utt13,1,Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
train/dia910_utt14,1,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
train/dia911_utt0,1,Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade,
train/dia911_utt1,3,Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
train/dia911_utt2,2,What the hell!
train/dia911_utt3,0,Okay.
train/dia911_utt4,0,All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
train/dia911_utt5,5,Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
train/dia912_utt0,2,My God!
train/dia912_utt1,2,These pants are burning up!
train/dia912_utt2,2,Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
train/dia912_utt3,4,What is she trying to kill me?
train/dia912_utt4,2,It's like a volcano in here!
train/dia912_utt5,0,Are you hot?
train/dia912_utt6,0,Okay, it must just be me then.
train/dia912_utt7,0,That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
train/dia913_utt0,4,You're driving me crazy with that!
train/dia913_utt1,0,Okay, I'll stop.
train/dia913_utt2,4,Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
train/dia913_utt3,4,Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
train/dia913_utt4,0,You wanna play?
train/dia913_utt5,0,Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.
train/dia913_utt6,0,And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
train/dia913_utt7,0,Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
train/dia913_utt8,1,All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
train/dia913_utt9,0,I'm intrigued.
train/dia913_utt10,0,All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
train/dia913_utt11,1,Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
train/dia913_utt12,1,Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
train/dia913_utt13,0,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
train/dia913_utt14,0,Uh yeah, right here.
train/dia914_utt0,1,Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
train/dia914_utt1,0,What's that?
train/dia914_utt2,0,Weeeell, it's rum, and-
train/dia915_utt0,0,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
train/dia915_utt1,0,Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
train/dia915_utt2,0,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
train/dia915_utt3,3,You are really frightening me.
train/dia915_utt4,3,Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
train/dia915_utt5,0,All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
train/dia915_utt6,0,All right, honey, time to start pushing.
train/dia915_utt7,3,But they're not here yet!
train/dia915_utt8,0,I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
train/dia915_utt9,3,Oh, god.
train/dia916_utt0,1,Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
train/dia916_utt1,0,Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
train/dia916_utt2,1,Aw, we-we are so  So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you.
train/dia916_utt3,1,And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.
train/dia916_utt4,0,Okay.
train/dia916_utt5,0,I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun.
train/dia916_utt6,1,It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right?
train/dia916_utt7,0,So where-where is it going?
train/dia916_utt8,2,Ah!
train/dia916_utt9,0,That's-that's the real question.
train/dia916_utt10,1,And-and the answer is is it's going somewhere fun.
train/dia916_utt11,0,Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger.
train/dia916_utt12,3,No I mean No not you, not you, you you
train/dia916_utt13,6,I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?
train/dia917_utt0,0,Y'know what?
train/dia917_utt1,1,I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
train/dia917_utt2,1,I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
train/dia917_utt3,4,No?
train/dia917_utt4,2,Really?
train/dia917_utt5,1,They taste so good.
train/dia918_utt0,0,Drum roll.
train/dia918_utt1,0,Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
train/dia918_utt2,0,Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
train/dia918_utt3,0,All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
train/dia918_utt4,2,You're actually going through with this?
train/dia918_utt5,4,Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
train/dia918_utt6,0,Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women  So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
train/dia918_utt7,4,You got problems because of you!
train/dia918_utt8,6,Not your name!
train/dia918_utt9,4,All right, this has got to stop!
train/dia918_utt10,4,Chandler is a great name!
train/dia918_utt11,6,In fact yes,  I'm, I'm sorry.
train/dia918_utt12,0,I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
train/dia919_utt0,2,Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
train/dia919_utt1,0,It was.
train/dia920_utt0,6,Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
train/dia920_utt1,2,Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
train/dia920_utt2,0,No.
train/dia920_utt3,2,Whoa. That was really good.
train/dia920_utt4,0,Thanks, any suggestions?
train/dia921_utt0,2,You-you you had sex with Ursula?!
train/dia921_utt1,3,Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
train/dia921_utt2,2,You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
train/dia921_utt3,6,Well I was just so excited to see you.
train/dia921_utt4,5,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.

train/dia924_utt0,1,Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that's him! That's him!
train/dia924_utt1,1,Great! Go get him.
train/dia924_utt2,0,Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
train/dia924_utt3,0,He's not really my type.
train/dia924_utt4,0,No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.
train/dia924_utt5,6,But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
train/dia924_utt6,6,You do attract some stinkers.
train/dia925_utt0,0,Chandler.
train/dia925_utt1,0,Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
train/dia925_utt2,0,Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.

train/dia925_utt7,1,Really.
train/dia925_utt8,0,Nothing.
train/dia926_utt0,0,Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
train/dia926_utt1,6,Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
train/dia926_utt2,6,No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
train/dia926_utt3,0,Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
train/dia926_utt4,4,No, no, I keep trying, y'know?
train/dia926_utt5,6,I can get out, "Joey, I have too " but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, " go to the bathroom."
train/dia926_utt6,0,He may think I'm sick.
train/dia926_utt7,0,Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I  We just have to get it over with!

train/dia927_utt3,0,Yeah!
train/dia927_utt4,2,Oh my God! Eh! Well
train/dia928_utt0,5,You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
train/dia928_utt1,0,He's gonna go up to the counter with

train/dia930_utt14,0,No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
train/dia930_utt15,4,What are you talking about? Bitch.
train/dia931_utt0,1,I know you botched that operation on purpose.
train/dia931_utt1,4,I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.
train/dia931_utt2,5,I don't care if you    are my brother.
train/dia932_utt0,1,Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!

train/dia932_utt2,1,Hey!
train/dia932_utt3,1,Hey!
train/dia932_utt4,4,I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
train/dia932_utt5,3,No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
train/dia932_utt6,4,Please, what about you and Chandler?
train/dia932_utt7,4,That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
train/dia932_utt8,4,Well hello !
train/dia932_utt9,0,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
train/dia932_utt10,4,I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
train/dia932_utt11,0,Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
train/dia932_utt12,1,I'm gonna do it.
train/dia932_utt13,0,And I can't stop you.
train/dia932_utt14,0,No.
train/dia932_utt15,0,Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
train/dia932_utt16,0,I'm smarter than
train/dia933_utt0,1,Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
train/dia933_utt1,1,Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
train/dia933_utt2,0,Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink,  cause I'm heading up there.
train/dia933_utt3,0,Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
train/dia933_utt4,1,Sure.  Coffee?  Cause I'm going up there.
train/dia933_utt5,0,No.
train/dia933_utt6,0,No, thank you.
train/dia933_utt7,0,You guys need anything,  cause I'm heading up there.
train/dia933_utt8,0,I'd love an ice water.
train/dia933_utt9,0,You got it.
train/dia933_utt10,2,Joey, what are you doing?
train/dia933_utt11,4,Just being friendly.
train/dia933_utt12,4,Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
train/dia933_utt13,0,Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
train/dia933_utt14,4,Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
train/dia933_utt15,6,Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
train/dia933_utt16,2,Joey, do you work here?
train/dia933_utt17,0,No.
train/dia933_utt18,0,Hey, waiter.
train/dia933_utt19,0,Yeah?
train/dia934_utt0,0,You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening.  Yeah we are.
train/dia934_utt1,0,Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
train/dia934_utt2,0,I'm calling for Monica Geller.
train/dia934_utt3,0,I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
train/dia934_utt4,2,This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groom No! Not the groom!!
train/dia935_utt0,0,Thank you.
train/dia935_utt1,0,Thanks.
train/dia935_utt2,4,I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
train/dia935_utt3,0,Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
train/dia935_utt4,6,This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
train/dia935_utt5,0,So go fix it!
train/dia935_utt6,0,Go find Chandler!
train/dia935_utt7,6,He's probably up in your room!
train/dia935_utt8,4,Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
train/dia935_utt9,1,Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
train/dia935_utt10,1,Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
train/dia935_utt11,0,Anybody lose this?
train/dia935_utt12,1,Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
train/dia935_utt13,0,Hmm.
train/dia936_utt0,0,Do you remember where the duck food is?
train/dia936_utt1,2,Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
train/dia936_utt2,0,Because I'm going to London.
train/dia936_utt3,2,What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
train/dia936_utt4,0,Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
train/dia936_utt5,0,Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
train/dia936_utt6,3,I Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
train/dia936_utt7,3,Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
train/dia936_utt8,6,But I have to tell him how I feel!
train/dia936_utt9,0,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
train/dia936_utt10,6,That's not why you're going!
train/dia936_utt11,6,You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
train/dia936_utt12,6,Forget that British chippy."
train/dia936_utt13,2,Ohh Do you think he will?!
train/dia936_utt14,6,No!
train/dia936_utt15,6,Because he's in love with the British chippy!
train/dia936_utt16,4,Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!
train/dia936_utt17,4,Y'know, it's too late!
train/dia936_utt18,6,You missed you're chance!
train/dia936_utt19,6,I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
train/dia936_utt20,4,Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
train/dia936_utt21,1,I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
train/dia937_utt0,0,So is everybody here?
train/dia937_utt1,0,I got here a little early myself.
train/dia937_utt2,0,Let us begin.
train/dia937_utt3,0,Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.
train/dia937_utt4,0,Here.
train/dia937_utt5,0,Here.
train/dia937_utt6,0,Now as for the hydrosaurs
train/dia938_utt0,0,Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
train/dia938_utt1,6,I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry.
train/dia938_utt2,6,So, do you think you can forgive me?
train/dia938_utt3,1,Great.
train/dia938_utt4,1,Thanks.
train/dia938_utt5,0,Okay, bye.
train/dia938_utt6,0,Hello, Jennifer?
train/dia938_utt7,2,Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?
train/dia938_utt8,2,Oh, she's not home huh?
train/dia938_utt9,0,Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
train/dia939_utt0,4,Hey!
train/dia939_utt1,0,Hi.
train/dia939_utt2,0,Are you all right?
train/dia939_utt3,3,Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
train/dia939_utt4,2,Oh my God! He did it?
train/dia939_utt5,1,Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
train/dia939_utt6,2,Are you kidding?
train/dia939_utt7,1,I'm like the one who talked him into it.
train/dia939_utt8,6,I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
train/dia939_utt9,6,And you really think this is a good idea?
train/dia939_utt10,0,I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.
train/dia939_utt11,6,I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
train/dia939_utt12,2,Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.
train/dia939_utt13,2,Really?! Even Ross?
train/dia939_utt14,1,Especially Ross!
train/dia939_utt15,0,Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come  back later.
train/dia939_utt16,2,Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll  come back.
train/dia939_utt17,1,There he goes, your fiancée.
train/dia939_utt18,0,I guess so.
train/dia939_utt19,0,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
train/dia939_utt20,0,I can't say that I'm surprised.
train/dia940_utt0,6,Oh, that is so unfortunate.
train/dia940_utt1,0,What?
train/dia940_utt2,1,Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
train/dia940_utt3,0,Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
train/dia940_utt4,0,You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
train/dia940_utt5,0,Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.
train/dia940_utt6,1,Bye-bye!  That's why I moved out.
train/dia940_utt7,0,Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
train/dia940_utt8,0,I think on some levels she already knows.
train/dia941_utt0,0,Night Mon. Night Julio.
train/dia941_utt1,0,Adiós.
train/dia941_utt2,2,Look Julio, someone left their book here.
train/dia941_utt3,0,Ah actually, that is mine.
train/dia941_utt4,0,Oh yeah, what are you reading?
train/dia941_utt5,0,Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
train/dia941_utt6,0,Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?
train/dia941_utt7,0,I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
train/dia941_utt8,0,Your a poet and don't know it.
train/dia941_utt9,0,Actually I ah, I am a poet.
train/dia941_utt10,0,Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
train/dia941_utt11,0,Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
train/dia941_utt12,0,Mine?  Right here?
train/dia941_utt13,1,I can write an epic poem about this lip.
train/dia941_utt14,1,How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
train/dia942_utt0,0,Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
train/dia942_utt1,2,What?
train/dia942_utt2,0,I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
train/dia942_utt3,2,What?
train/dia942_utt4,0,We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
train/dia942_utt5,2,Are we really in Montreal?!
train/dia942_utt6,0,Yes we are. So, coffee?
train/dia942_utt7,0,Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
train/dia942_utt8,0,Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
train/dia943_utt0,0,Okay, here's batch 22.
train/dia943_utt1,4,Oh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's.
train/dia943_utt2,0,This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
train/dia943_utt3,0,Let's give it a shot.
train/dia943_utt4,2,Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
train/dia943_utt5,0,No, just a Friday night.
train/dia944_utt0,0,Would she?
train/dia944_utt1,4,Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
train/dia945_utt0,5,Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
train/dia945_utt1,6,I know honey, I'm sorry.
train/dia945_utt2,6,Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
train/dia945_utt3,1,Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
train/dia945_utt4,6,Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't....
train/dia945_utt5,5,I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
train/dia945_utt6,4,Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
train/dia945_utt7,3,I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
train/dia945_utt8,4,It's not funny, this is actually my job.
train/dia945_utt9,0,Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
train/dia945_utt10,1,Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
train/dia945_utt11,1,And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
train/dia945_utt12,0,Ah, just one other thing.
train/dia945_utt13,1,Yes?!
train/dia945_utt14,0,I ah, I work at
train/dia945_utt15,0,Do you want my pickle?
train/dia946_utt0,0,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
train/dia946_utt1,2,Why?
train/dia946_utt2,0,Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
train/dia946_utt3,2,Oh my God.
train/dia946_utt4,0,Phoebe.
train/dia946_utt5,0,Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
train/dia946_utt6,1,Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
train/dia946_utt7,4,He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
train/dia946_utt8,1,We should do something. Whistle.
train/dia946_utt9,4,We are not going to whistle.
train/dia946_utt10,0,Come on, do it.
train/dia946_utt11,4,No!
train/dia946_utt12,1,Do it!
train/dia946_utt13,4,No!
train/dia946_utt14,1,Do it do it do it!
train/dia946_utt15,1,Woo-woo!
train/dia946_utt16,2,I can't believe you did that!
train/dia947_utt0,0,Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
train/dia947_utt1,2,Still?
train/dia947_utt2,0,I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
train/dia947_utt3,1,I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
train/dia947_utt4,4,Either eat it, or be in it.
train/dia947_utt5,1,Spoon?  So, what do you think?
train/dia947_utt6,5,I'm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
train/dia947_utt7,1,Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. there's a new class comin' in.
train/dia947_utt8,0,Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
train/dia947_utt9,0,I can.
train/dia947_utt10,0,Okay, go ahead.
train/dia947_utt11,0,Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
train/dia947_utt12,0,That's very good, what's your name?
train/dia947_utt13,0,Monica.
train/dia947_utt14,0,Monica, you go to the head of the class.
train/dia947_utt15,1,Okay.
train/dia948_utt0,0,And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.
train/dia948_utt1,0,But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
train/dia948_utt2,0,Human spleeeen.
train/dia948_utt3,1,Olé!
train/dia948_utt4,2,What are you doing here!
train/dia948_utt5,1,Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!
train/dia948_utt6,1,Great!
train/dia948_utt7,1,Yeah!
train/dia948_utt8,1,It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!
train/dia948_utt9,1,Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
train/dia948_utt10,1,Listen Phoebe...
train/dia948_utt11,0,Yeah.
train/dia948_utt12,0,You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...
train/dia948_utt13,0,But what?
train/dia948_utt14,0,This is kind of a classy place.
train/dia948_utt15,0,Ok, say no more.
train/dia949_utt0,6,I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
train/dia949_utt1,0,Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
train/dia949_utt2,1,Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
train/dia949_utt3,1,Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
train/dia949_utt4,0,I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
train/dia949_utt5,0,Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
train/dia949_utt6,6,We can't. We're not pharmacists!
train/dia949_utt7,0,I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
train/dia949_utt8,0,Kate Miller?
train/dia949_utt9,0,Kate Miller it is.
train/dia949_utt10,1,And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
train/dia949_utt11,0,In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
train/dia949_utt12,0,Thank you.
train/dia950_utt0,2,Oh my God!
train/dia950_utt1,6,We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
train/dia950_utt2,4,This year was supposed to be great!
train/dia950_utt3,5,But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
train/dia950_utt4,6,No. No, you're not a loser.
train/dia950_utt5,4,Look at me!
train/dia950_utt6,1,Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
train/dia950_utt7,6,Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
train/dia950_utt8,1,See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
train/dia950_utt9,1,That really is something.. that's really cool.
train/dia950_utt10,1,Howdy partner!
train/dia950_utt11,1,Maybe I should get another pair!
train/dia950_utt12,1,Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
train/dia950_utt13,1,I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
train/dia950_utt14,1,I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
train/dia950_utt15,1,I would make a good cowboy.
train/dia950_utt16,0,Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
train/dia950_utt17,0,Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
train/dia951_utt0,4,No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
train/dia951_utt1,2,Oh yeah!
train/dia952_utt0,0,Great nap.
train/dia952_utt1,0,It really was.
train/dia952_utt2,1,Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
train/dia952_utt3,0,So, let's talk about women. I'm sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
train/dia952_utt4,0,Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
train/dia952_utt5,5,Oh, please!
train/dia952_utt6,0,Hey, how you doin'?
train/dia953_utt0,0,Hey Mikey
train/dia953_utt1,0,Hey P
train/dia953_utt2,0,What are you doing?
train/dia953_utt3,0,Setting rattraps
train/dia953_utt4,2,To kill Bob??
train/dia953_utt5,0,No, no, to test his neck strength.
train/dia953_utt6,4,No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!
train/dia953_utt7,6,I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
train/dia953_utt8,0,Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
train/dia953_utt9,0,I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
train/dia953_utt10,3,Bob?
train/dia953_utt11,6,Bob!
train/dia953_utt12,4,Robert!
train/dia953_utt13,0,Oh wait, I think I hear him.
train/dia953_utt14,2,Oh - Oh my god!
train/dia953_utt15,2,Bob    had babies!
train/dia953_utt16,2,Bob's a mom!
train/dia953_utt17,0,Better think of a new name for him.
train/dia953_utt18,0,I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
train/dia953_utt19,0,I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
train/dia953_utt20,6,Oh my god, we killed Bob!
train/dia953_utt21,0,Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
train/dia953_utt22,0,Suzie
train/dia954_utt0,1,Hmmm, soup!
train/dia954_utt1,0,Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?

train/dia968_utt7,1,If he goes first he can!
train/dia969_utt0,4,Yeah!
train/dia969_utt1,0,Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know?
train/dia969_utt2,0,Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.

train/dia972_utt4,0,Oh right.
train/dia972_utt5,0,Right.
train/dia972_utt6,1,Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you  til you cried?
train/dia972_utt7,6,We're probably too old to do that now.
train/dia972_utt8,1,I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
train/dia972_utt9,1,Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
train/dia972_utt10,2,It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
train/dia972_utt11,0,Well I'm, I'm a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
train/dia973_utt0,0,Relax every muscle in your body.
train/dia973_utt1,0,Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
train/dia973_utt2,0,Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.
train/dia973_utt3,0,Okay, tell me your happy place.

train/dia973_utt11,6,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
train/dia973_utt12,1,All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
train/dia973_utt13,6,I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
train/dia973_utt14,0,All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.
train/dia973_utt15,0,Okay.
train/dia973_utt16,1,Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
train/dia973_utt17,0,And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
train/dia973_utt18,5,Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
train/dia974_utt0,0,OK sweetie, I'll see you later.

train/dia976_utt6,0,Her name is Stephanie... something.
train/dia976_utt7,0,She's supposed to be very good.
train/dia976_utt8,2,But what about Phoebe?
train/dia976_utt9,5,Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
train/dia976_utt10,6,Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
train/dia976_utt11,0,Uh...
train/dia976_utt12,3,Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
train/dia977_utt0,6,Ahh, no.

train/dia977_utt2,2,Are you jealous?
train/dia977_utt3,4,Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
train/dia977_utt4,4,I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
train/dia977_utt5,1,You are totally jealous.

train/dia977_utt12,2,Huh.
train/dia977_utt13,1,Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
train/dia977_utt14,0,Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
train/dia978_utt0,2,I can't believe you came back.
train/dia978_utt1,1,Don't say anything.
train/dia978_utt2,0,I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think.
train/dia978_utt3,1,I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
train/dia978_utt4,1,Rachel! Rachel!
train/dia978_utt5,0,What?

train/dia979_utt3,2,God!
train/dia979_utt4,1,All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
train/dia979_utt5,0,Well actually, Ross doesn't.
train/dia979_utt6,0,Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
train/dia980_utt0,0,Dear Mary-Angela.
train/dia980_utt1,0,Hi.
train/dia980_utt2,0,How?s it going.
train/dia980_utt3,6,This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.
train/dia980_utt4,5,What the hell?s a matter with you?
train/dia980_utt5,4,How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
train/dia980_utt6,0,Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.
train/dia980_utt7,0,All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person.
train/dia980_utt8,0,At least you know her name.
train/dia980_utt9,0,You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
train/dia980_utt10,3,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
train/dia980_utt11,6,Where in Cuba?
train/dia981_utt0,0,Hey.

train/dia983_utt1,0,I'm still on the set!
train/dia983_utt2,4,Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
train/dia983_utt3,6,I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
train/dia983_utt4,6,Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.

train/dia984_utt0,1,Oh hey Joey! What's up?
train/dia984_utt1,0,I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
train/dia984_utt2,0,Yeah, I've been around.
train/dia984_utt3,0,Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
train/dia984_utt4,0,Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
train/dia984_utt5,1,Great! Problem solved!
train/dia985_utt0,6,Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
train/dia985_utt1,0,All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
train/dia985_utt2,2,Why?
train/dia985_utt3,6,Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
train/dia985_utt4,4,Bastard!
train/dia986_utt0,2,You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or Oh!
train/dia986_utt1,2,All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
train/dia986_utt2,1,Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
train/dia986_utt3,2,Oh, I can't believe it!
train/dia986_utt4,1,I mean I think it's great!
train/dia986_utt5,0,For him.
train/dia986_utt6,0,She might be able to do better.
train/dia986_utt7,0,Hey guys!
train/dia986_utt8,0,Joey! Come here! Come here!
train/dia986_utt9,0,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
train/dia986_utt10,0,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
train/dia986_utt11,0,No. Joey, she
train/dia986_utt12,2,Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
train/dia986_utt13,0,Yes, but y'know what?
train/dia986_utt14,0,It doesn't matter who knows what.
train/dia986_utt15,0,Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
train/dia986_utt16,1,Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
train/dia987_utt0,0,It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
train/dia988_utt0,0,Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
train/dia988_utt1,2,You really think it would be that different?
train/dia988_utt2,2,How could it not be?
train/dia988_utt3,6,I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
train/dia988_utt4,6,And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a
train/dia988_utt5,0,Well, things change.
train/dia988_utt6,6,I don't want them to move to a
train/dia988_utt7,0,It'll be okay Joe.
train/dia989_utt0,2,Its still there!
train/dia989_utt1,0,Mrs. Braverman must be out.
train/dia989_utt2,6,She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
train/dia989_utt3,3,By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
train/dia989_utt4,3,No that could kill her.
train/dia989_utt5,0,Well, we don't want that.
train/dia989_utt6,0,No, so we're protecting her.
train/dia989_utt7,0,But we should take it.
train/dia989_utt8,3,But we should move quick.
train/dia989_utt9,2,Why?
train/dia989_utt10,3,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
train/dia989_utt11,3,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
train/dia990_utt0,0,Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
train/dia990_utt1,0,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
train/dia990_utt2,0,Well, you're gonna.
train/dia990_utt3,0,I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
train/dia990_utt4,0,Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
train/dia990_utt5,0,Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
train/dia990_utt6,6,And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
train/dia990_utt7,0,Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
train/dia990_utt8,0,Hey, you're not him.
train/dia990_utt9,0,You're you.
train/dia990_utt10,0,When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
train/dia990_utt11,0,No.
train/dia990_utt12,0,No.
train/dia990_utt13,0,You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
train/dia990_utt14,0,Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!
train/dia990_utt15,0,And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
train/dia990_utt16,1,You really think so?
train/dia990_utt17,0,Yeah. I really do.
train/dia990_utt18,0,Thanks, Chandler.
train/dia990_utt19,4,Get off!
train/dia991_utt0,0,Hi.
train/dia991_utt1,0,Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
train/dia991_utt2,0,When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
train/dia991_utt3,0,And the cream?
train/dia991_utt4,0,Cheese makes me thirsty.
train/dia991_utt5,0,Okay. Let's move on.
train/dia991_utt6,0,All right.
train/dia991_utt7,2,Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?
train/dia991_utt8,2,Oh no!
train/dia991_utt9,0,I don't know anything about cooking.
train/dia991_utt10,0,I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
train/dia991_utt11,1,Well, hats off to the chef.
train/dia991_utt12,0,I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
train/dia991_utt13,1,The chef!
train/dia991_utt14,1,That's right.
train/dia992_utt0,0,Hey, Pheebs.
train/dia992_utt1,0,Hey.
train/dia992_utt2,0,How's it going?
train/dia992_utt3,1,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
train/dia992_utt4,0,So what's going on?
train/dia992_utt5,0,Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
train/dia992_utt6,0,I dunno, there's just something about...
train/dia992_utt7,0,Basically we just feel that he's...
train/dia992_utt8,5,We hate that guy.
train/dia992_utt9,5,Yeah. Hate him.
train/dia992_utt10,6,We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
train/dia992_utt11,0,Uh-huh.
train/dia992_utt12,0,Okay.
train/dia992_utt13,0,Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
train/dia992_utt14,5,...No, we hate him.
train/dia992_utt15,6,We're sorry.
train/dia993_utt0,1,Hey!
train/dia993_utt1,1,Hey!
train/dia993_utt2,0,What are you doing?
train/dia993_utt3,0,I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
train/dia994_utt0,3,Yes that was mine.
train/dia994_utt1,0,Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
train/dia994_utt2,6,Yes that would have made more sense.
train/dia994_utt3,4,Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!
train/dia994_utt4,0,All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.
train/dia994_utt5,0,And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.
train/dia994_utt6,4,Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
train/dia995_utt0,4,Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
train/dia995_utt1,0,Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
train/dia996_utt0,2,She said what?
train/dia996_utt1,0,She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
train/dia996_utt2,1,Postpone it?
train/dia996_utt3,4,Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
train/dia996_utt4,4,Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
train/dia996_utt5,0,This isn't right.
train/dia996_utt6,6,I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
train/dia996_utt7,4,I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
train/dia996_utt8,4,Don't you point your pants at me!
train/dia996_utt9,4,We have no choice!
train/dia996_utt10,4,Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand?
train/dia996_utt11,4,This is our wedding I'm talking about.
train/dia996_utt12,0,The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
train/dia996_utt13,4,So what are you saying? It's now or never?
train/dia996_utt14,0,No. I'm saying it's now.
train/dia996_utt15,4,Or?
train/dia996_utt16,4,There's no  or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
train/dia996_utt17,4,It's not the pants.
train/dia996_utt18,4,It's you that is backwards.
train/dia996_utt19,4,And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
train/dia996_utt20,6,No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please 
train/dia997_utt0,0,Hi, honey.
train/dia997_utt1,0,See you later.
train/dia997_utt2,1,What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
train/dia997_utt3,4,Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
train/dia997_utt4,0,Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
train/dia997_utt5,2,Oh no!
train/dia997_utt6,0,I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
train/dia997_utt7,3,Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
train/dia997_utt8,2,This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
train/dia997_utt9,4,NOOOO!!!!!!!!
train/dia998_utt0,2,Ma! What're you doing here?
train/dia998_utt1,0,I came to give you this  and this.
train/dia998_utt2,2,Oww! Big ring!
train/dia999_utt0,0,Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
train/dia999_utt1,0,Do you uh, do you talk about me?
train/dia999_utt2,0,Yeah, yeah, all the time.
train/dia999_utt3,2,Really?
train/dia999_utt4,0,But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
train/dia1000_utt0,5,Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
train/dia1000_utt1,5,Have you ever seen so much crap?
train/dia1000_utt2,4,Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
train/dia1000_utt3,0,Check this out. Can I have this?
train/dia1001_utt0,0,What?
train/dia1001_utt1,0,I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
train/dia1001_utt2,0,All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
train/dia1001_utt3,1,It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
train/dia1001_utt4,6,If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
train/dia1001_utt5,1,Fortunately, it is me.
train/dia1001_utt6,1,And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
train/dia1001_utt7,1,Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
train/dia1001_utt8,0,Y'know, someplace nice.
train/dia1001_utt9,0,Yeah, someplace nice.
train/dia1001_utt10,1,Yeah!
train/dia1001_utt11,0,How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
train/dia1002_utt0,0,So, what do you think?
train/dia1002_utt1,1,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
train/dia1002_utt2,1,I know!
train/dia1002_utt3,0,So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
train/dia1002_utt4,1,Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
train/dia1002_utt5,1,Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
train/dia1003_utt0,0,Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
train/dia1003_utt1,0,Gotcha.
train/dia1003_utt2,0,This place is really my Grandmother's.
train/dia1003_utt3,0,I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
train/dia1003_utt4,0,So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR.
train/dia1003_utt5,0,So are you thirsty?
train/dia1003_utt6,1,Oh, you bet I am!
train/dia1003_utt7,2,Okay, here's your penis!
train/dia1004_utt0,0,Ohh, okay.
train/dia1004_utt1,1,Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
train/dia1004_utt2,0,Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
train/dia1005_utt0,0,Hey, ready for dinner?
train/dia1005_utt1,1,Ooh, absolutely!
train/dia1005_utt2,1,Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
train/dia1005_utt3,0,Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.
train/dia1005_utt4,0,How about Mama Lisettie's?
train/dia1005_utt5,0,Enh. Sure!
train/dia1005_utt6,5,I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
train/dia1005_utt7,0,Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
train/dia1005_utt8,0,That this milk is mine.
train/dia1005_utt9,0,I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
train/dia1005_utt10,1,Okay, let's go!
train/dia1005_utt11,4,Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the
train/dia1005_utt12,0,But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
train/dia1005_utt13,5,Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
train/dia1005_utt14,4,Okay, stop!
train/dia1005_utt15,0,Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
train/dia1005_utt16,4,Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
train/dia1005_utt17,0,Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
train/dia1005_utt18,1,Thank you.
train/dia1005_utt19,0,Go!
train/dia1005_utt20,4,Go!
train/dia1005_utt21,5,Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
train/dia1006_utt0,6,No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
train/dia1006_utt1,1,No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
train/dia1006_utt2,6,I know. I'm sorry.
train/dia1006_utt3,0,All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
train/dia1006_utt4,0,Yeah.
train/dia1006_utt5,0,God, what a mess.
train/dia1007_utt0,0,Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
train/dia1007_utt1,6,Well, I lost.
train/dia1007_utt2,6,Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.
train/dia1007_utt3,4,Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
train/dia1007_utt4,1,Hey! How'd the interview go?
train/dia1007_utt5,6,Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
train/dia1007_utt6,6,Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
train/dia1007_utt7,6,That's not how that was supposed to come out.
train/dia1007_utt8,6,This is the worst Christmas ever.
train/dia1007_utt9,0,Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
train/dia1007_utt10,4,I can't!
train/dia1007_utt11,4,It's too late!
train/dia1007_utt12,6,Terry already hired that girl over there.
train/dia1007_utt13,6,Look at her, she's even got waitress experience.
train/dia1007_utt14,6,Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
train/dia1007_utt15,0,That word was swans.
train/dia1008_utt0,2,What do we got there?
train/dia1008_utt1,2,A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
train/dia1008_utt2,1,You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
train/dia1008_utt3,0,It's all right.
train/dia1008_utt4,0,It's all right.
train/dia1008_utt5,0,You don't have to explain.
train/dia1008_utt6,0,This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
train/dia1008_utt7,0,You're our third call tonight.
train/dia1008_utt8,2,Really?
train/dia1008_utt9,0,Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
train/dia1009_utt0,6,I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
train/dia1009_utt1,0,No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
train/dia1009_utt2,1,Thank God. Food.
train/dia1009_utt3,0,Phoebe?
train/dia1009_utt4,0,What?
train/dia1009_utt5,0,Do you have a plan?
train/dia1009_utt6,1,I don't even have a 'pl'.
train/dia1009_utt7,6,No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
train/dia1009_utt8,2,Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
train/dia1009_utt9,2,Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
train/dia1009_utt10,1,Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
train/dia1009_utt11,1,And-and a power tie?
train/dia1009_utt12,2,Oh God.

train/dia1016_utt7,1,Ross, thank God.
train/dia1016_utt8,2,Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
train/dia1016_utt9,5,I ate a bug.
train/dia1016_utt10,1,Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up.
train/dia1016_utt11,3,Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
train/dia1016_utt12,1,Oh, now you want a favour?
train/dia1016_utt13,0,Yes, please.
train/dia1016_utt14,4,Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
train/dia1016_utt15,0,Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
train/dia1016_utt16,4,No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
train/dia1016_utt17,0,Listen, we both know you're gonna do it  cause you're not a jerk.
train/dia1016_utt18,4,So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
train/dia1016_utt19,4,No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
train/dia1016_utt20,0,Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you  cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
train/dia1016_utt21,0,Yeah, you're right.
train/dia1017_utt0,6,God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
train/dia1017_utt1,6,Oh, I know.
train/dia1017_utt2,6,I kinda feel like it's my fault.
train/dia1017_utt3,4,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
train/dia1017_utt4,4,Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
train/dia1017_utt5,4,Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
train/dia1017_utt6,0,All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
train/dia1017_utt7,4,Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
train/dia1017_utt8,4,Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.
train/dia1017_utt9,4,Okay, I admit it!
train/dia1017_utt10,1,I love this coat!
train/dia1017_utt11,1,Okay, I it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!
train/dia1017_utt12,0,Remember Phil Huntley?
train/dia1017_utt13,1,He was fine!
train/dia1018_utt0,1,So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!
train/dia1018_utt1,3,Oh no
